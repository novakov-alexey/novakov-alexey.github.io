is one more optimization algorithm used in neural networks. It is based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. It has more hyper-parameters than classic Gradient Descent to tune externally\nGood default settings for the tested machine learning problems are:\n\nα =  0.001, // learning rate. We have already seen this one in classic Gradient Descent.\nβ1 = 0.9,\nβ2 = 0.999\neps = 10−8.\n\n\nValues on the right-hand side are proposed in the paper. However, you should tune them on your data,\nalso experiment with batch size and other parameters which may influence the Adam parameters.\nAlgorithm\nLet's look at original algorithm and then try to implement it in the code.\nAll operations on vectors are element-wise.  With β1t and β2t\nwe denote β1 and β2 to the power of t.\nRequire: α: Stepsize\nRequire: β1, β2 ∈[0,1): Exponential decay rates for the moment estimates\nRequire: f(θ): Stochastic objective function with parameters θ\nRequire: θ0: Initial parameter vector\nm0 ← 0 (Initialize 1st moment vector)\nv0 ← 0 (Initialize 2nd moment vector)\nt ← 0 (Initialize timestep)\nwhile θt not converged do\nt ← t + 1\ngt ← ∇θft (θt−1) (Get gradients w.r.t. stochastic objective at timestep t)\nmt ← β1 · mt−1 + (1−β1) · gt (Update biased first moment estimate)\nvt ← β2 · vt−1 + (1−β2) · g2t (Update biased second raw moment estimate)̂\nmt ← mt / (1−βt1) (Compute bias-corrected first moment estimate)̂\nvt ← vt / (1−βt2) (Compute bias-corrected second raw moment estimate)\nθt ← θt−1−α·̂mt/(√̂vt +eps) (Update parameters)\nend while\nreturn θt (Resulting parameters)\nAt the last line we update parameters based on long chain of formulas which incorporate gradient and moments.\nImplementation\nChanges to existing library\nIn order to implement Adam for multi-layer neural network with backpropogation we will need to translate above algorithm to\nlinear algebra and Tensor API that we wrote in previous articles. Apart from that we would need to\nadd additional state to Layer type:\n\nWe assume that any optimizer may bring its own state apart of the usual weight and bias matrices, so we model\nnew property as trait and add implementation for Adam:\n\nWe also need to initialise this state properties with zeros. For that, we extend layer construction code to let the optimizer type class\nto init its properties.\nFirst, we change add method in the Sequential type:\n\nOptimizer trait now gets additional method:\n\nAdam implementation for initState:\n\nTensor.zero method creates new tensor with zeros using the same shape as original tensor.\nAlso, we need to keep Adam hyper-parameters somewhere. Let's create OptimizerCfg class and Adam extension in it.\nWe could design custom configuration nicely, for example, using traits, but I have decided to make it \"dirty\" at the moment:\n\nUpdate Weights using Adam\nWe now have all abstraction in place as well as all parameters to implement Adam optimizer.\nIn fact, first part to calculate gradient (partial derivative) will be the same as in classic gradient descent algorithm.\nSecond part will be Adam's own stuff:\n\nThe difference with classic gradient optimizer is:\n\ntimestep is an index across all training epochs and intermediate batches. Its range: [1 .. epochs * data.length / batchSize]\ncorrection function that goes after Adam paper to calculate final learning rate based on the weight or bias gradient.\nWe keep Adam moments for weight and bias AdamState as part of the Layer state across all learning epochs.\n\nThere is an extension to Tensor API I have added to support element-wise operations like:\n\ndivision def :/(that: T): Tensor[T]\nmultiplication (t: T) def *:(that: Tensor[T]): Tensor[T]\npower: def :**(to: Int): Tensor[T]\nsquare: def sqr: Tensor[T] = TensorOps.pow(t, 2)\nsqrt: def sqrt: Tensor[T] = TensorOps.sqrt(t)\n\nVisualisation\nWe are going to visualise Adam gradient trace to global minimum using Picta. So all we do is constructing ANN with Adam type parameter:\n\nLoss surface:\n\n\n\n\nAlso, we going to compare it on the same data with classic Gradient Descent:\n\n\n\n\nAdam gradient starts a bit differently then classic gradient descent. Eventually, they both converges at the same point.\nIf we compare the speed of finding global minimum, then on my data and on the same learning hyper-parameters, classic Gradient Descent is faster:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that orange line is slightly behind the blue one. Around 9th learning epoch they are both in the same position.\nSummary\nWe could easily extend existing library with one more optimizer such as Adam. It is quite popular optimizer nowadays as it shows\ngood result in the paper and in practise. Anyway, it did not show better results on my data comparing to classic gradient descent algorithm.\nMy experiment is not proving that Adam is not good, but it is just showing that in real life you need to experiment with\ndifferent weight optimisers. Also, you should tune hyper-parameters for each algorithm separately, i.e. reuse of the same hyper-parameters\nmight not help to get the best results out of another optimizer you are currently trying.\nLinks\n\nSource code - Optimizers\nReference Implementation for perceptron\nPaper: Adam: a method for stochastic optimization\nMXNET: Adam from scratch\n\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/adam-optimizer/","title":"Linear Regression with Adam Optimizer"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/algorithms-max-sum-in-array/":{"body":"Most of the algorithmic tasks are related to iterating over arrays of data.

Ammonite project consists of a REPL, script launcher and a few Scala libraries.\nLet’s write a script to generate JSON data and send it to Apache Kafka topic.\nCreate scripts\nWe are going to create two scripts. One script will be importing another script definitions.\nIn this case will be able to organise our code in modules. Even short scripts may become complex and should be a bit organised for better code maintenance.\nFirst Script - Generate Data\n\nThis script imports two libraries:\n\nscalacheck for data generation\ncirce to format case classes to JSON text\n\n\ngenBatch is main function in this script to be used by another/main script. It generates List[String] as return value.\nEvery string in the list is a JSON text to be sent to Kafka topic.\nSecond Script - Send Data\n\nAdd below Scala code statements to import Kafka library, Scala, Java classes into our script\n\nIn order to make this script executable we need to annotate one of the method by @main annotation:\n\nIn the main function we use regular Scala code to:\n\nread producer properties\nread Kafka broker/bootstrap hostnames\ncreate KafkaProducer using Java Kafka library API\nsend data to Kafka topic infinitely\n\nAbove main function can be executed now via:\n\nHowever, it won't compile until we add sendData function.\n\nsendData is calling genBatch() function from the first script common.sc. We imported all definitions from that script via import common._.\nAmmonite script launcher compiles all imported scripts automatically, so we need to import it only.\nIn the sendData function we generate List of JSON strings to send them via Kafka producer. In case we get an exception in producer's response, we\nthrow an exception to stop the script execution. In case there is no exception thrown by the Kafka producer, then sendData is\nsending data to Kafka topic again and again sleeping in between with the user given delay in milliseconds.\nExecute Script\nBefore we execute above script, we need to have two configuration files for Kafka Producer.\n\nFor example, I have the following properties. In your case, you will have some of them or none of them (if you rely on default Kafka\nproducer properties):\n\nAnother file that we used in the main script is file with Kafka broker hostnames. Put your broker hostname(s) or IP address(es) separaing by coma:\n\nFinally, if we run the main script, it will start to print the JSON data that is sent to Kafka topic:\n\nSummary\nIf you want to use Scala for scripting purposes, you can easily do that with Ammonite Scripts.\nIt allows you to import any JVM library from Sonatype public repository.\nAmmonite can be also configured to search any other public or private Maven, Ivy repositories.\nAnother cool feature of Ammonite Scripts is local file imports. That allows to write many scripts and organise them in modules, reuse them in many places.\nCode editor like VSCode and IntelliJ IDE support Ammonite Scripts well, so that you can benefit from auto-completion and \"go to definition\" features while writing your code\nwith Ammonite Scripts.\nStandard Scala SDK can also execute Scala file .scala as shell script.\nOne needs to add a special directive at the top of the file, so that the file will be executed via Scala compiler.

Tensor in computer science is a generic abstraction for N-dimensional array.\nIn our ANN implementation, we are going to use scalar numbers which are encoded as 0-dimension tensor, vector - encoded as 1-d tensor and\nfinally matrix - encoded as 2-d tensor. Vector and matrix are the most used building blocks for Deep Learning calculus. All tensor shapes we will\nuse are going to be rectangular - every element is the same size along each axis.\nDataset\nWe will take _Churn Modelling dataset which predicts whether a customer is going to leave the bank or not.\nThis dataset is traveling across many tutorials at the Internet,\nso that you can find a couple different code implementations among dozens of articles using the same data, so do I.\n\nThe last column is y, i.e. the value we want our ANN to predict between 0 and 1. Rest of the columns are x data, also known as features. We drop\nfirst 3 columns and the last column y before we use them as x matrix. Remaining columns:\n\nNetwork Topology\n\n\n\n\nAbove picture describes a network we are going to implement.\n\n\nN is a number of features, i.e. remaining columns from the input dataset.\n\n\nEach layer is fully connected with next layer. I draw each layer by skipping middle neurons to get smaller visual overhead.\n\n\nBetween each layer we have weights which form linear equations via dot product x * w + bias.\n\n\nEach layer has its own activation functions. We use ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) and Sigmoid functions.\n\n\nForward Propagation\nBasic idea of neural network implementation is to leverage math principals for matrix and vector multiplication. As neural network is going to be fully connected from layer to layer, we can represent learning and optimization algorithms as following:\nDimensions\nSingle training example\nIt is one data record:\n\nx: 12 input columns as 1 x 12 matrix\nw1: 12 x 6 matrix + 6 x 1 matrix for biases\nw2: 6 x 6 matrix + 6 x 1 matrix for biases\nw3: 6 x 1 matrix + 1 x 1 matrix for biases\nyHat: scalar number\n\nAn amount of hidden layers and neurons are parameters to be tuned by an expert, i.e. externally to the main algorithm.\nWe set 2 hidden layers with 6 neurons each. Our last layer\nis single neuron that produces final prediction, which we will treat as yes or no to answer customer churn question.\nMultiple training examples\nMini-batch approach, i.e. multiple training examples at once. Batch size to be tuned externally as well. Let's take 16 as batch size:\n\nx: 16 x 12 matrix\nw1: 12 x 6 matrix + 6 x 1 matrix for biases\nw2: 6 x 6 matrix + 6 x 1 matrix for biases\nw3: 6 x 1 matrix + 1 x 1 matrix for biases\nyHat: 16 x 1 matrix\n\nAs you can see, our matrices are equal in rows at input and output layers.\nThat means we can input any number of rows through the neural network at once when we do training or prediction.\nMath of the Forward propagation\nWhen we train neural network, we use input data and parameters on all hidden layers to reach output layer, so that we get the prediction value(s).\nFirst part of the ANN implementation that calculates predictions, i.e. yHat is called _forward propagation.\nLinear algebra helps us to feed data into the network and get the result using matrix multiplication principals. That makes the entire training and single\nprediction quite generic, so that we can easily program that in any programming language.\nIn a nutshell, our 12 x 6 x 6 x 1 network will form the following expressions for every training batch:\nFirst Hidden Layer\n\n\n\n\nAbove picture shows activations for the neurons of the first hidden layer. In fact, next layers are calculated in similar way.\n\n\nX is a matrix where each row is a data sample. Every column is a particular feature/column from the initial dataset. Usually, input column is scaled/encoded (see second article).\n\n\nWe use dot product operation for X and W.\nResulting matrix is used to add biases using element-wise addition. b1 will be added to each element of the first row of that resulting matrix,\nthen b2 to the second row and so on.\n\n\nSecond Hidden Layer\nThe x of the second layer is an a we calculated on the previous layer. We will call it a1.\n\nAbove pseudo-code shows matrix dimensions in the parenthesis.\nOutput Layer\nInput data is a2. Here we get out prediction at the end:\n\na3 a.k.a yHat represents a prediction for each data sample in the batch. Prediction values are probabilities between 0 and 1.\nIf you are confused with above explanation, I recommend to check great video series on Deep Learning: But what is a Neural Network? | Deep learning, chapter 1.\nBatch Tracing\nIn order to see what is going on with the state of neural network, let's feed one single batch into it.\nThere are different strategies for initial weights and biases initialisation. In our implementation we will follow:\n\nweight matrices are initialised using uniform-random\nbias vectors are initialised with zeros\n\nLater they will be updated via optimization algorithm.\nx - input\nBelow matrix is our x, which is our input data from the training or test set. The values it contains is a result of\ndata preparation step, which I will explain in details further:\n\nw1 - between input and 1st hidden layers\nweight:\n\nbias:\n\nw2 - between 1st and 2nd hidden layers\nweight:\n\nbias:\n\nw3 - between 2nd hidden and output layers\nweight:\n\nbias:\n\nyHat - Output layer\nPredictions for the input batch:\n\n\nAbove trace is for the first training batch at the very first epoch. You should not try understand these digits in weights, biases and outputs matrices.\nThey are going to change their values a lot after running training loop 100 times (epochs) with N batches each.\nBackward Propagation\nInitial weights and biases are not going to give us right equations to predict our y. Even if we propagate the entire dataset through the network.\nObviously, someone needs to update these parameters based on some feedback. This feedback is calculated via loss function.\nIn the science literature, loss function is also called as cost function. We are going to use loss and cost here as synonymous.\nThere are different loss functions in Deep Learning we can use. We will go with binary-cross-entropy as we predict binary value.\nOur loss value will show how good we are updating the network weights at specific training epoch. However, updates will be done using Gradient\nDescent optimization algorithm.\nGradient Descent optimization\nModel prediction is calculated through the forward propagation of the input data sample(s).\nIf weights and biases are trained well, then our predictions will be accurate as well. In order to say whether our model performs well,\nwe check loss value on every training cycle as well as accuracy metric. Accuracy is number of correct predictions divided by total number of data samples during the training or validation.\nYou might ask yourself - how can I train model parameters well? In other words how to update them in right direction, so that they give accurate predictions?\nHere we meet Gradient Descent.\nAs per Wikipedia:\n\n  Gradient descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable function\n  \n\nGradient descent is a way to minimise an objective loss function for neural network parameters. In other words, it helps to find best parameters by\nminimising loss function. Smaller loss, better overall network accuracy.\nUsing Gradient Descent, we are finding proper change rate on every training cycle.\nSo that we can update our weights and biases to get the best model performance.\nHow exactly the Gradient Descent algorithm calculates that change?\nThere are thousands of articles explaining that visually. In short, we are trying to find steepest descent of the derivative function.\nUsing small coefficient learningRate we subtract the gradient value from the initial parameter. That allows us to find best parameter and\nminimise the loss function. One of the good visual explanation for linear regression problem with gradient descent is here. It also works well for multiple linear regression like in our case, we got 12 features, so 12 independent variables.\nComing back to our back-propagation implementation. f'(x)is a derivative function of the layer's activation function. We use derivative function to update all weights except the last one, i.e. w1 and w2, not w3. To update w3, we use delta based on the error, i.e. predicted - actual.\nLayers w1 and w2 are using relu as activation function. Derivative of the relu function is following:\n\nSuch derivative function is applied element-wise to z matrix in the step #6 of the back propagation part (see second article for Scala reference implementation).\nMath of the Backward propagation\nBack-propagation part of ANN is a bit more complicated than forward propagation part.\nIn Gradient Descent Optimization algorithm, we calculate derivatives to calculate yHat rate of change with respect to last z, in our case it is z3.\nHigh-level steps of the Gradient Descent algorithm\n\nCalculate error based on actual y and on predicted yHat. It will be called delta further and in the code.\n\n\n\nIterate list of weights matrices from end to start, i.e. backwards.\nLet's take \"i\" as layer index\nCalculate partial derivative as:\n\n\n\nUpdate weights of i layer via:\n\n\n\nUpdate bias of i layer via:\n\n\n\n\nPass updated weight wi and delta to previous layer, i.e. to wi - 1.\n\n\nNow starting wi - 1 weight update, we calculate delta differently.\n\n\n\nIf i &gt; 0, then:\ndecrement i via i = i -1 and then repeat steps from 2 to 5.\notherwise:\nwe finished back-propagation for a specific batch or a single data sample (in case of stochastic gradient descent).\nBack-propagation tracing\nw3 - between 2nd hidden and output layers\nDelta (error):\n\nx transpose:\n\npartialDerivative3 = x.T * (delta multiply f`(z)):\n\nupdated Weight = w - learningRate * partialDerivative3 :\n\nupdated Bias = b - learningRate * sum(delta) :\n\nw2 - between 1st and 2nd hidden layers\ncurrent delta:\n\ncurrent derivative:\n\nupdated Weight:\n\nupdated Bias:\n\nw1 - between input and 1st hidden layers\ncurrent delta:\n\ncurrent derivative:\n\nupdated Weight:\n\nupdated Bias:\n\nWrapping up\nWe have finished with theoretical part and ready to continue with the second article ANN in Scala: implementation.\nIn case you have not gotten how the ANN is actually working in theory, then I encourage you to search for other articles and\nvideos. It is important to understand this part before looking at actual implementation in code.\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-in-scala-1/","title":"Artificial Neural Network in Scala - part 1"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-in-scala-2/":{"body":"In this article we are going to implement ANN from scratch in Scala. It is continuation of the first article, which describes\na theory of ANN.\nThis implementation will consist of:\n\n\nMini-library for sub-set of Tensor calculus\nMini-library for data preparation\nA DSL for Neural Network creation, including layers\nPluggable weights optimizer\nPluggable implementation of activation and loss functions\nPluggable training metric calculation\n\nEverything will be implemented in pure Scala without using any third-party code.\nBy pluggable I mean extendable, i.e. a user can provide own implementation by implementing Scala trait.\nNeural network and data preprocessing APIs are inspired by Keras and scikit-learn libraries.\nTensor Library\nBefore starting our journey into the world of linear algebra we need good support for Tensor calculus such as\nmultiplication, addition, subtraction, transponding operations. Without these operations, we will clutter the\nmain algorithm so that another person, who will be reading our code, may lost. It is very easy to be blown\naway by pile of code which is trying to mimic math. Scala is perfect language to implement math expression as\nit supports custom operands by using symbols as definitions (variables, methods, etc.), i.e. we can implement \"*\" or any other math operations as part of our custom type Tensor.\nBelow we define Tensor trait for a generic type T. Later, we will set boundaries for T. It must have given\ninstances of ClassTag and Numeric types for array creation and general numerical computations.\n\nIn extension section we add lots of operations that our generic Tensor is going to support. Some of them are symbolic like\n* and -. Other operations are more traditional methods such as map or sum.\nNote that * and multiply are two different operations. From math perspective, the first one is a dot product\nanother one is a Hadamard product. Most of the time, we will use \"dot product\" operation,\nhowever in one place Hadamard product is going to be used (back-propagation part).\nAll extension methods are delegating the operations to plain Scala functions in the Tensor singleton object.\nBefore checking some of the implementations for Tensor operations, let's look on 3 cases of Tensor itself.\n\nFrom math perspective, first instance is a scalar number, second is a vector and third is a matrix. Of course, we could implement\ntensors in more generic way and invent some N-dimensional array that would support 3, 4 and any number of dimensions,\nbut I think from our personal learning perspective, making more concrete hard-coded classes would be easier to understand the whole ANN\nimplementation.\nMatmul\nLet's look only at one important operation from Tensor API which is dot product.\n\n\nFirst we select specific type of multiplication based on the tensor dimension.\nIf tensor is not scalar, then we try to use matrix multiplication. Here, if some of the operands is vector we make that vector as matrix\nwith one column according to math convention.\nLater we check operands dimensions, as they must obey rules of\nmatrix multiplication. If rules are not met we throw an error. No Scala Either type or other error modelling is used to not clutter the code. Our goal is to stay as close as possible to math and keep balance between using types and readability.\n\nSee source code on GitHub for full implementation of tensor library.\nNeural Network DSL\nLet's define a trait for abstract model that can learn:\n\nThe first two methods are the main ones.\n\nWe can use train to provide input features as x and target values as y, specify\nnumber of training cycles as epochs to learn the right parameters for future predictions.\npredict allows us to infer target value by giving only x data\nreset cleans model weights, so that it initialises them again upon next training\ncurrentWeights and losses are returning weights and losses of the last training cycle.\n\nMachine learning model is a stateful thing. It keeps list of parameters called weights and biases of type List[Weight[T]].\nThese parameters are the heart of the model. They are mutating on every training epoch and data batch.\nModel initialisation\nBefore designing neural network training API, let's look at entities we need:\n\nWe have modelled network parameters as traits with implementations as case classes. Later we use\nthem to create an instance of the model.\n\nThere are bunch of parameters that we need in simple sequential model with fully connected layers:\n\nGeneric type T is numeric type of the data which can be Float, Double, Int, etc. Most of the time you want numbers with floating point in machine learning.\nRandom generator can be provided as contextual abstraction (given instance). It is used to initialise\nweights and biases for every layer.\nGeneric U is a type of optimisation algorithm that we use in back-propagation part of the training cycle. Also given as type class instance.\nlearningRate and batchSize are hyper-parameters to be tuned externally.\nweightStack is a function that construct list of initial layers based on the provided earlier Layer configuration via\nmethod add.  It is not supposed to be called manually. The weightStack function is called by train\nmethod internally to create initial list of weights, if weights are empty. If they\nare not empty, they are reused.\n\nThis is how a user is supposed to use such API:\n\nThere is a type SimpleGD that picks up a required instance of Optimizer implementation. See details below.\nTraining loop\ntrain method runs trainEpoch multiple times, which is equal to epochs parameter.\nEvery training epoch returns new weights list, which is used again for the next epoch. This loop may run, for example, 100 times.\nAlso, we collect a list of average loss values and print a user metric value. We have set accuracy metric as per code earlier.\n\ntrainEpoch is implementing forward- and back-propagation for every data sample batch:\n\nGradient Descent Optimizer\nNow let's look at optimizer code. It implements standard gradient descent algorithm:\n\nIn order to update weights an optimizer needs:\n\nthe list of weights to update\ncurrent activations for all layers\ncalculated error: yHat vs. y\nlearningRate parameter, which is static for the entire training cycle\n\nSimpleGD type is a token to summon an optimizer instance. In future, we can extend optimizers with other algorithms.\nData batching is happening outside of the optimizer, in the train method.\nWe can select either full batch or mini-batch training by specifying a number of records in the batch.\nSo that is why this optimizer is not specific type of gradient descent (stochastic, mini-batch, batch), but just works with\nwhatever weights are given for updates.\nActual implementation of the gradient descent optimization:\n\nThe weights update starts from tail and moves to the head of the list, i.e. from the last layer to the first hidden layer.\nweights and activations are equal in length, since the last one is produced via the weight list during the forward-propagation.\nThe complex part is calculating the delta that we use for partial derivative.\n\nInitial delta is equal to error. Next layer is calculating delta on its own, which is a dot product of previous layer delta and weights.\nLast layer does not have previous weights.\nEvery delta is then multiplied by activation function derivative: f.derivative(z).\nThe rest part is simpler and more or less linear. We calculate partialDerivative and update layer weights and biases.\nWe pass current layer weight and delta to the next layer. Usage of foldRight helps us easily to pass these parameters to the next layer.\n\nThis folding loop returns updated list of weights, which is, of course, has equal length comapre to the original list.\nData Preparation\nBefore we start learning, we need to prepare initial data for the training.\nUnfortunately, data preparation requires us quite a lot of code to write.\n\n\nFirst, we load raw data from a CSV file, then we select all columns between 3-rd and last one (-1 means: length - 1).\nInitial data is of String type, later we choose numerical data type such as Float.\nWe compose label, one-hot encoders and data type transformer into a function inside the createEncoders function. That allows us to use prepareData function later for validation dataset.\ny data we take from the last column of the dataset.\n\nI am not going to describe the entire code of data preparation classes. The goal of encoders is to\nprepare data for deep neural network training and inference. We normalise all columns as per their individual means and\nstandard deviations. Also, we encode categorical columns using 0 and 1 using one-hot encoding approach.\nTraining Run\n\nWe split x and y data into 80% and 20% parts for training and testing accordingly.\nFinally, we execute the training for 100 epochs.\n\nWe can see that accuracy is increasing quite quick. Also, loss value is becoming stable already after 20 epochs.\nEntire training for 8000 data samples takes less than 6 seconds.\nTesting\nSingle Test\n\nWe use predict method on the model to test prediction on the single data sample:\n\nDataset Test\nWe have left 20% of the initial data for testing purposes. So now we can check trained model accuracy on new data\nthat model had never seen before:\n\nModel accuracy on unseen data is quite as well:\n\nPython Implementation\nAlmost the same implementation in Python takes much longer to train the model.\nAlthough, we are using a bit more advanced optimizer such as Adam.\nHere is the code snippet that starts model training:\n\n\nIt is almost 5 times longer. I knew that Python is slow language.\nSee full code here: tensorflow-ann-python\nSummary\nWe have seen that Scala implementation looks very concise thanks to the great language design.\nIt also works faster than Python implementation in Keras on CPU.\nArtificial Neural Network can be understood by newbies as magic,\nbut a closer look shows that basic building blocks are just math.\nBeing a functional programmer in Scala, you may find that some of the code is not doing total functions, but partial functions by throwing erros.\nUnfortunatelly, there are several possibilities where user may provide\nwrong inputs from math perspective, so that we could return an Either.Left or something like that to mitigate this problem.\nMaking a machine learning library is fun, since it is just algorithms and in-memory computations.\nYou do not need to deal with that much I/O, networking or distributed systems programming.\nMain part even does not parallelise, so no concurrency and cognitive overhead related with it.\nOf course, to make an ML library today for real life, you would require support of GPU for faster, parallel computation.\nImplemented code demonstrates two points:\n\nANN is an algorithm that you can implement yourself in any programming language. No magic is involved.\nScala is a perfect language to implement libraries for data science and machine learning.\n\nSource Code\nEntire code of the Scala ANN implementation can be found here:\nhttps://github.com/novakov-alexey/deep-learning-scala\nReference Links\n\n\nArtificial-Neural-Network-ANN-4-Backpropagation\n\n\nbackpropagation---the-heart-of-neural-networks\n\n\nAn overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms\n\n\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-in-scala-2/","title":"Artificial Neural Network in Scala - part 2"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-mnist/":{"body":"Deep Feed Forward Neural Network is one of the type of Artificial Neural Networks, which is also able to classify computer images.\nIn order to feed pixel data into the neural net in RBG/Greyscale/other format one can map every pixel to network inputs.\nThat means every pixel becomes a feature.

We are going to prove this.\nPlease note, there are additional type of networks which are more efficient in image classification such as Convolutional Neural Network, but we are going to talk about that next time.\nDataset\n\n\nMNIST dataset is a \"Hello, World!\" dataset in the field of Deep Learning.\nIt consists of thousands of grey-scaled images which represent hand-written digits from 0 to 9,\nso 10 labels. This dataset is used by many researches in the field to evaluate their discoveries and test that on well-known dataset.\nHowever, MNIST dataset should not be a panacea. There are other public datasets with images like ImageNet, AlexNet, etc.,\nwhich are more advanced as they have more objects than just hand-written digits.\nNevertheless, MNIST made important contribution to the history of Deep Learning and still helps people to learn this field by playing with this dataset.\nLoading Data\nMNIST dataset can be taken from Yann LeCun web-site: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. If it is unavailable, you can easily find\na copy of this dataset in numerous GitHub repositories, since it is not big in size (for example here). I have downloaded the following 4 archives and put into the folder images.\n\nFirst two files is training dataset. Bigger file is for images and smaller is for labels. There are 60000 training images and labels for them.\nNext two files are for model testing following the same concept (images, labels). There are 10000 testing images and labels.\nIn order to load these files into the  memory we need to follow MNIST file format specification.\nFor each file we need to do:\n\nRead first magic number and compare it with MNIST expected number, which is:\n\n\n\nRead next number for number of rows\nRead next number for number of columns\nRead images and labels in the loop based on the number of rows and columns\n\nWe are going to implement MNIST classification on top of the existing mini-libary for Deep Learning.\nHere is how we can load MNIST dataset:\n\nPreparing data\nBefore we construct a neural network to train it on MNIST dataset, we need to transform it a bit.\nFeature normalisation\nIn order to be more efficient when learning weights we need to scale X data to be in [0, 1] data range.\nWe know that every image is encoded as a matrix of pixels 28 x 28. If print one of the\nimage data into the console with line breaks after 28-th element, then it will look like this:\n\nAbove output corresponds to digit \"7\".\nData in 0-255 numeric range will explode our network gradient if we do not apply any optimization technique on\ngradient or weight values. The easiest way is to scale the input data.\nFirst we load data using previously defined function with one more case class as a wrapper:\n\nwhere dataset is wrapped into a case class:\n\nThen we simply divide every value by 255, that gives data in [0,1] range format.\n\nTarget Encoding\nOur model is going to predict one label over multi-class dataset. In order to make our neural network\nto predict something we need to encode label tensor with One-Hot encoder, so that every scalar label becomes as\na vector of zeros and a single 1. Index of 1 corresponds to the digit that this label stores.\nMNIST data is currently a vector of numbers, where number is a label for hand-written digit. For example:\n\nOnce we one-hot encode it, it will look like:\n\nWe can reuse OneHotEncoder implemented earlier:\n\nCommon preparation\nLet's wrap both transformation into one function:\n\nNow we can call it like this:\n\nModel construction\nOur model is going to be designed/trained with:\n\nnodes: 784 x 100 x 10\nactivation: ReLU, Softmax\nloss: cross-entropy\naccuracy: via argmax\ninitialisation: Kaiming\noptimizer: Adam\n\n\nAdam optimizer gets better results on MNIST data, so we stick to it, rather than with standard Stochastic Gradient Descent.\nActivations\nWe have already seen ReLU activation function, but let's recall its definition:\n\nImportant note here that it is applied element-wise, i.e. for every element of z matrix in the layer.\nHowever, softmax activation function is applied across nodes of the layer to get the probability which sums up to 1.\nThis activation function is a typical choice for multi-class problem type. When we feed input data sample into the network,\nwe want to get an output as vector with probabilities for each class.\nComing back to MNIST target, below representation shows that most likely the target value is digit \"4\",\nbecause the highest argument is \"0.5\" at index [4].\n\nThis is how we can implement softmax:\n\nIt is obviously more complicated than relu. This is what the above code is doing:\n\nFor each row: Array[T] of the x Tensor we find a max value and substract it from each value of this row to get stable values in the vector.\nThe reason to subtract max is to avoid numeric overflow.\nApply exponent to each value right after the max subtraction.\nMake a sum of exponents.\nFinally, use exponent vector to divide each value by the sum.\nAdditionally, we raise an error if a sum of individual values in\nthe vector is not equal to 1. Such situation may happen\ndue to numeric overflow. If it happens, then we may end up with exploding gradient (as a result bad training outcome).\nHowever, we tolerate numeric difference of 0.4E-15d, i.e. it should be no more than 1.0000000000000004.\n\nIn order to perform back-propagation with gradient descent we need softmax derivative as well.\nThis is simplest version of softmax derivative:\n\nLoss function\nCross-entropy can then be used to calculate the difference between the two probability distributions and\ntypical choice for multi-class classification. It can written in code as:\n\nIt will return some value as a as difference. Example of input vectors:\n\nTo get an idea whey cross-entropy is a usefull loss function to our problem, please have a look at this blog-post.\nAccuracy\nBefore we calculate a number of correct predictions, we need to not just compare y and yHat vectors,\nbut first need to find an index of the max element in the y and yHat vectors.\nSo we need to help the existing algorithm to extract from the yHat vector the value of the label, i.e. predicted digit.\nFunction called argmax can be used for this task:\n\nAccuracy is a Metric type-class that has matches method to return a number of correct predictions.\nThe argMax itself as generic tensor function:\n\nWeight Initialisation\nWeight initialisation approach is important factor in Deep Learning to converge model training faster or even to avoid vanished or exploded gradient.\nKaiming weight initialisation is helping to address above problems. So let's use that as well:\n\nWe initialise biases to zeros. Weight matrices are initialised using random generator with normal distribution. Every random number then\nmultiplied by sqrt(2 / n), where n is a number of input nodes for this particular layer.\nModel Training\nNow we are ready to start training process.\n\n\nWe have gotten quite good accuracy on training.\n98.4% correct predictions, which is 1.6% errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Testing\n\nAccuracy on test data is quite close to the train accuracy:\n\nWe can also try to run a single test on the first image from the test dataset:\n\n\nSummary\nWe have seen that even one hidden layer is able to classify MNIST dataset with quite low error rate.\nKey takeaways when classifying images are:\n\nmake sure that gradient is not going to explode or vanish. For that, we can use proper weight initialisation,\nclipping gradient by value or norm any other weight normalisation during the training. Also scale or normalise the input data\nuse one-hot encoding for your target variable in case of multi-class classification\nin case of single label prediction, use argmax function\nuse softmax activation at the last layer to distribute probabilities across classes.\n\nTry Convolutional Neural Network as a next step in image classification problem.\nLinks\n\nSource code of mini-library: deep-learning-scala\nMNIST Handwritten digits classification from scratch using Python Numpy\nsoftmax.py eliben/deep-learning-samples\n\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-mnist/","title":"MNIST image recognition using Deep Feed Forward Network"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/aws-saa-exam/":{"body":"Earlier this year I started learning few Udemy courses for AWS Solution Architect Associate Certification. My initial plan was just to get some basic knowledge about AWS services, not the certification itself. Before starting the course, I did not have any experience with native AWS services. I never used EC2 instances to launch something in production. However, I used EC2 fleet of instances to deploy Kubernetes cluster. I started my path to cloud-native tools with Docker and shifted later to Kubernetes and OpenShift. Pure AWS services were never on my radar. I think the experience of deploying Kubernetes on top of the EC2 instances is one thing, but using different AWS services like ELB, EBS, EFS, EC2 and S3 is completely another story. So I decided it is time to get to know what are those AWS main services. After coming to the end of the Udemy course, I realised it worth to go for certification to make a final point in my AWS education. As I already spent so much time.\n\n\n\n\nEventually I got certification after 7 calendar months. During that time, I did several pauses for vacation and other activities at work, when\nlearning AWS was too hard to keep in my head. Perhaps, pure learning time was from 3 to 4 months.\nPreparation\nThe final path I followed looks likes this:\n\nMain Udemy preparation courses:\n\nAWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - 2020 SAA-C02 from Neal Davis\nUltimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate 2020 from Stephane Maarek\n\n\nAWS Free Video Courses\nAWS related project at work ;-)\nUdemy SAA Practise Exams from Neal Davis\nUdemy AWS VPC and Networking in Depth from Chetan Agrawal\n\nThe best learning was in a project at work. However, theoretical knowledge helped quiet a lot to be fast in practise.\nHow to pass the exam\nEvery Udemy preparation course contains a series of labs almost for every lecture. Let's say a block on AWS VPC (Virtual Public Cloud) has 15 lectures, then there are around 10 labs that you need to practise on your own.\nComposition of the theoretical and practical labs at platform like Udemy plus real experience at work\ngives you a high chance to pass the certification for \"Associate\" level. Recommended practical experience from Amazon to pass \"Associate\" level is 1 year.\nI spent several times less with regards to practical experience. I believe those who already has practical experience of 1 year with AWS can easily\nwatch one of the MOOC course and straight away go for certification exam. If you want to go for certification in relaxed mode, then take your time\nby working on some project at work related to AWS.\nThe hardest thing is to motivate yourself to go for certification after one or more years of working with AWS. I think some people will eventually loose the\nmotivation in certification, since they are already so professional that they might think the certification is just waist of time.\nBy end the day, the certification exam is also a stressful exercise. You either have to go to a certification centre in your city or go for online exam at home or office. So it gives you some headache.\nRecommendations\nTake notes\nAfter watching and practising with topic number 10 out of 25 topics I quickly realised that I should have been taking some summary notes for\nlecture I watched and practised before. So that I could quickly review my notes and recall those topics I learnt earlier. I started making an AWS mind map.\nSince I was using mind maps for almost 10 years already, it was natural choice for me. The mind mapping software I use called XMind.\nSo I started to do mind map in the middle of the first course, then I fulfilled the missing topics while watching second course, so that it covers\nall possible topics related to Solution Architect Associate certification. Eventually, I got around 1600 nodes in my mind map tree. XMind software\nperformance is not good on my old 8 GB RAM laptop. It is probably not good practise to create such big mind maps. I could probably go with a separate mind map\nper AWS topic or separate tab in the same map, but then I would ended up with 20 different maps or tabs.\nA text search across different mind maps would be a nightmare then. If you know a solution for big mind map problem, please let me know.\nBelow picture show some part of the AWS mind map I created as summary notes:\n\n\n\n\nMy mind map became so big that I can't really print it easily, if I would want that.\nYou can go with your own way of making notes. The important thing is to do them, rather than trying to keep everything in your head. Some people say\nthat hand-written notes are the best way to remember a lot in your head. I am always struggling with handwritten notes to transfer them into digital format.\nThere are some tools for that, but it is not straightforward. So I abandoned an idea of paper or tablet handwritten notes until some time in future.\nOne thing with regards to mind map, I think a mind map is useful only for the mind map author. If I read someone else's mind map, I can't remember it nor learn something with it. A mind map is a personal tool like personal notes in a notebook. There is only you who can understand your notes, since it reflects your brain work.\nYoutube\nDo not waste time by watching free videos on youtube for AWS certification, since it is not going to be a complete course. They will probably not provide\npractise test after each topic nor test exams with 65 questions each. This is the state of 2020 year. Maybe in future the things get change on Youtube,\nso that we will be able to do full blown MOOCs there as well. We will see.\nExam Topics\nI am software developer by trade. Back in my university I had no any strong focus on computer networking. This topic was the most difficult for me at AWS\ncertification. All those Sys Admin related things like block storage, VPN, firewall (security groups, network ACL), network file systems, encryption, DNS\ntook me several iteration until I finally learnt that.\nBelow is a list of topics which are required from you to learn to pass the certification exam.\n1. VPC\nIt is huge block that includes many things to get familiar with:\n\nIP ranges / CIDRs\nGateway Endpoint\nVPC endpoint\nSecurity group, Network ACL\nSubnet\nNAT Gateway, Instance\nSite-to-Site VPN\nDirect Connect\nTransit Gateway\nRoute table\nVPC flow logs\nPrivate Link\nVPC peering\nVPN CloudHub\nInterface endpoint\n\nThis topic was the most difficult for me. All that I listed above you need to know well before going to Solution Architect certification.\n2. EC2\nIt is also quite large and popular topic on the exam. Requires to know:\n\nPricing Models: Reserved, On-Demand, Dedicated, Scheduled, etc.\nRelation to AMIs (VM images), location of AMIs, etc.\nPlacement groups: cluster, spread, partition\nIP address types: private public, Elastic IP\nHPC features: EFA, Enhanced Networking\nEC2 instance lifecycle\nEC2 API: user, meta data\n\nThis topic was tricky for me as well, after being working for several years with Kubernetes. I did not care what underlying infrastructure was used.\nVMs or bare-metal servers. Anyway, I found EC2 topic as important as VPC. Basically, it is one of the building block of the AWS. You must know\nthis topic very well.\n3. ELB, Route53, CDN\nElastic Load Balancing is popular topic too.\n\nGeneral idea is to know how different load balancers can be used with EC2 instances, Target Groups.\nDifferent target types: EC2, IP, Lambda function\nWhen to use ALB, NLB or CLB\nAuto Scaling group connection with ELB and Target Groups\nRelation to CloudWatch and EC2 metrics\nDifferent features like Global Accelerator, HA setup using Availability Zones, stick sessions. multi-VPC balancing\nWAF\nDNS record sets\nRoute 53 DNS policies (latency, failover, geo-proximity, etc.)\nCloudFront\n\n4. Security\n\nKMS: key types from management perspective, supported encryption algorithms\nS3 data encryption types at rest (quite popular topic)\nEncryption support per data storage and database service: EBS, EFS, RDS, etc.\nHigh-level knowledge on different services for security like Certification Manager, Shield, Artefact\n\n5. Databases &amp; Data Processing\n\nRDS master and replica encryption. There are several lifecycle transitions to remember like how to make encrypted database from unencrypted database.\nAurora, Serverless, Global\nDynamoDB\nKinesis, Firehose\nRedShift\nAthena\nGlue\nEMR\nData Migration Service\nElasticCache: difference between Redis and Memcached\nDataSync\nNeptune\n\nRDS, DynamoDB are the most popular topics on the exam. However, you need to know main capabilities of other databases/tools.\n6. Integration\n\nSQS\nSNS\nAmazon MQ\nStep Functions\nSystem Manager Parameter Store\nSWF\nAppSync\n\nYou need to know the difference between SQS versus SNS very well.\n7. IAM\n\nUsers, Groups, Roles, Policies\nAuthentication types\nOrganization and SCP\nResource Access Manager\n\n8. Storage\nAs I mention, it was quite hard topic for me, since you need to remember the IOPS per each disk type,\nstorage class durability, availability, minimum storage period, retrieval period, prices\nThere are many sub-options to keep in mind. It is quite large topic and as popular on the exam as VPC and EC2.\n\nEBS\nEFS\nS3\nInstance Store\nStorage Gateway\nFSx for Windows, Lustre\n\n9. Dev Tools\n\nLambda\nAPI Gateway\nSAM\nECS, ECR, Fargate, EKS\nCodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline (just know what they are offering)\n\n10. Operations\n\nOpsWorks\nCloud Formation\nServer Migration Service\nRecovery strategies: Backup and Restore, Pilot light, Warm Standby, Multi Site\n\n11. Monitoring, Auditing\n\nCloudWatch Logs, Alarms, Events\nCloudTrail\nTrustedAdvisor\nAWS Config\n\nThose service that I have not commented above you just need high-level understanding what they do and that is enough.\nWhen and How to go for Exam\nOnce you feel it is time to get a certification exam, make sure you have passed through any test / simulation exam at Udemy, anywhere you can find them.\nCheck sample questions at AWS training web-site.\nIn my case, it was very helpful to study right answers for failed questions at Udemy test exams.\nBasically, these simulation tests already show you a percentage result whether you can pass real exam and how close you are to 72% of right answers.\nI think if you above 80% right answers you can go for exam.\nThese days everything is happening remotely as well as certification at AWS. You can schedule an exam by make an order at \"aws.training / certmetrics\" web-sites.\nChose exam provider and day for an exam.\nIn my case, I could schedule an exam on next day I checked the available time slots, so there is\nno long time waiting to schedule an exam.\nIf you feel that you are already overloaded with the theory while preparing for an exam, then it is a sign that you are ready to for the certification.\nOf course, need to try all possible test exams and see if you get good percentage of right answers. Some people do not pass from the first time, but\nmost of the time pass from the second attempt. So do not bother if you did not pass first time, it is going to be a good rehearsal since you will be able\nto see real questions and get familiar with level of complexity. As for me, it was very important to know how difficult those real exam questions.\nOnce I started the exam I realised that I can cope with the real questions.\nOne last recommendation, do not stay too long on one question during the real exam. I would say 1.5 minute per question\nshould be enough. Some questions can be answered within 10 seconds. It highly depends on the question length. Udemy test exams have lengthy question and that is quite close to reality.\nSummary\nAlthough it requires quite a lot of time and efforts to go for any certification, it worth to do just because you will really learn a lot.\nI would not learn that amount of knowledge in case I would just watch the video course. Also, certification may help you\nto win a good project if you are working in a company or for yourself as a contractor.\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/aws-saa-exam/","title":"Path to AWS Solution Architect Certification"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/cnn-in-scala/":{"body":"Last time we used ANN to train a Deep Learning model for image recognition using MNIST dataset.\nThis time we are going to look at more advanced network called Convolutional Neural Network or CNN in short.\nCNN is designed to tackle image recognition problem. However, it can be used not only for image recognition.\nAs we have seen last time, ANN using just hidden layers can learn quite well on MNIST.\nHowever, for real life use cases we need higher accuracy. The main idea of CNN is to learn how to recognise object in their different shapes and positions\nusing specific features of the image data. The goal of CNN is better model regularisation by using convolution and pooling operations.\n\nCNN adds two more type of layers:\n\nConvolution layer\nMax, Average or Global Pooling layer\n\nConvolution is a mathematical operation, which is used in CNN layers instead of matrix multiplication like in fully-connected (dense) layers.\nTypical CNN may consist of several Convolutional and Pooling layers. Final part of the network consists of the fully-connected layers like in ANN.\nBelow picture is showing typical CNN architecture with Tensor shapes. For example, 32x32x1 is an input image 32 pixels width and height having 1 color channel:\n\n\n\n\nI will clarify what other shapes dimensions mean further.\nCNN Topology\nWe are going to design a simple CNN architecture for image recognition of the MNIST dataset. The problem type will be still the same:\npredict a hand-written digit based on input image data. CNN works with image properties like height, width and color depth (RGB, etc.).\nBasically, it uses image pixel matrices to perform convolution and pooling operations.\nCNN works with every color channel separately. After some point, channels add up to each other using element-wise addition.\nI am going to build CNN using my existing mini-library in Scala:\n\nThere are 3 more layers that we have not seen before.\nConvolution Layer\nConv2D is a Scala case class which has already familiar to us relu parameter as an activation function. Other unique parameters of convolution layer:\n\nfilterCount = 8 - number of filters which are going to be trained/optimised via gradient descent and back-propagation\nkernel  = (5, 5) - window height and width to apply on input image/matrix\nstrides = (1, 1) - increment value when moving filter over the input image/matrix to the right (1 and to the bottom 1)\n\nWhile implementing CNN we are going to enter the world of 4-dimensional tensors. Conv2D layer will keep its data in 4D Tensor where:\n\n1st dimension is filter count\n2nd - color depth. Grey scale image is 1, RGB is 3, RGBA is 4 and so on.\n3rd - filter height\n4th - filter width\n\nAccording to above code snippet, added filter will have the following trainable weights and biases:\n\nweights shape: (8 x 1 x 5 x 5) Tensor4D\nbiases shape: (8) Tensor1D\n\nExample\nIf we take simple example as image matrix 3 x 4 and filter with weights set from 1 to 4 then we get the following output as z:\n\n\n\n\nz value at (0, 0) position is elementwise multiplication and then sum of the elements of the matrix such as\n1 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 3 * 2 + 3 * 4 = 23. Other output elements of the z matrix are produced in the same way.\nEvery layer that we add to Sequential model has at least two methods apply,\nwhich is used to do forward propagation and backward for producing gradients based on the layer input data.\nWe can code forward propagation like this:\n\nI have left private modifier to show you that apply function uses other functions internally.\nIn general, forward propagation of the Convolution layer is not that simple as for Dense layer.\nConvolution layer is also computationally intensive in forward and backward propagation.\nThe main line of code in forward propagation is (region |*| filterChannel).sum. It corresponds to element-wise multiplication of two matrices and summing the resulting matrix up\nto get single number as one of the value for the output matrix.\nTensor shape of the forward propagation can be calculated in advance using the following formula:\n\nimages is a number of images passed via apply, i.e. during the forward propagation. That means we can process a batch of images at once, i.e. at a step.\nWe use similar idea in Dense layers via 2D Tensor to pass multiple images as rows at once (see further).\nPooling Layer\nTypical pooling layer that is used for CNN is Max Pooling. As denoted by its name, it pools maximum elements from some image region to place it into the output matrix.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough above example is quite simple, it shows the idea how forward propagation of MaxPool layer works. Basically, it downsamples input image resolution and takes the most\nbright pixels.\nHere is how we can code max pooling forward propagation:\n\nFlatten2D\nBefore we feed intermediate data from the Convolution and Pooling layers forward, we need to flatten every image to a vector. Image channels are going to be\nappended to each other to get a single vector per image.\nOur Tensor4D becomes a Tensor2D, where every row is an image. It is going to be still a long row per image, but since we have done some convolutions on the input\nimage, such processed data helps a model to learn better and avoid overfitting.\nAgain, real-life CNN network will have multiple convolution and pooling layers, which are not necessarily\ndecrease amount of features, but transform them to achieve better model regularisation.\nThis layer forward propagation is going to be very simple to implement:\n\nWhere .as2D is combining all nested arrays of 4D Tensor starting from axis = 1.\nWhen we flatten input data we get 4232 long vector image. To summarise the Tensor shapes we get the following output shapes:\n\nConv2D shape: 128 x 8 x 24 x 24\nMaxPool shape: 128 x 8 x 23 x 23\nFlatten: 128 x 4232\nDense shape: 128 x 32\nDense shape: 128 x 1\n\nSummary\nIf I run training for 5 epochs it takes a lot time than before with ANN.\n\nFirst of all we have more feature now with CNN = 4232 to learn in fully-connected layers.\nBut the main slowness comes from the forward and backward computation of the convolutional and pooling layers. They are much slower than simple dense layer matrix multiplication.\nThis takes up to 1 hour to train on MNIST on 50k images. The highest accuracy score I got was 92%, which is much lower than with ANN = 98.5%.\nAs we have too few layers and most probably exploding/vanishing gradient I could not better result with CNN.

One of the benefit of this algorithm is it can be trained without\nspending too much efforst on data preparation and it is fast comparing to more complex algorithms like Neural Networks.\nIn this blog post we are going to implement CART algorithm, which stands for Classification and Regression trees. There are many other algorithms in decision trees space,\nbut we will not describe them in this blog post.\nData science practitioners often use decision tree algorithms to compare their performance with more advanced algorithms.\nAlthough decision tree is fast to train, its accuracy metric usually lower than accuracy on the other algorithms like deep feed forward networks\nor something more advanced using the same dataset. However, you do not always need high accuracy value,\nso using CART and other decision tree ensemble algorithms may be enough for solving particular problem.\nCART Algorithm\nThe whole algorithm can be described in several steps:\n\n\nBuilding in-memory tree data structure based on input training tabular data:\na. Find the best split question to divide input rows into two branches\nb. Repeat split for both branches recursively\n\n\nUsing in-memory tree data structure to classify unseen data samples.\n\n\nBelow is a decision tree in different scales we will build further.\nSee a link to GitHub repo, which contains code store a decision tree as JSON file, so that you can visualize stoted JSON objects using any online JSON tree visualizer tool.\nFit-to-sreen view of further implemented decision tree:\n\n\n\n\nZoomed view to read some tree questions:\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Blocks\nWe need several auxiliary data types to implement CART algorithms:\n\nDecision Tree object will be built using the following types:\n\nTree assembling\nCART algorithm is using Gini impurity and Information Gain metrics in order to build efficient tree.\nGini impurity from Wikipedia:\n\nInformation gain from Wikipedia:\n\nLet's encode this in programming language:\n\nIn order to find the best question and make an efficient split for remaining rows, we need to implement a function like rows: Rows =&gt; (Float, Option[Question]).\nThe first member of the tuple is info gain:\n\nAt this point we have all pieces to compose and get the CART algorithm done:\n\nDecision Tree Classifier\nIn order to use built Decision Tree data structure we need one more function classify.\nIt goes through the tree by using input data sample until it reaches terminal Leaf node:\n\nDemo on Custom Churn Dataset\nWe are going to use Customer Churn dataset, which I already used in Artificial Neural Networks blog post.\nInput features of this dataset are:\n\nLet's load it from CSV file and split into two sub-sets for training and testing phases. Dataset consists of 10 000 data samples, so we get 8000 samples for training\nand 2000 samples for testing:\n\nUsing training data to build in-memory decision tree:\n\nNow we can use it to classify test dataset and calculate accuracy metric in the same time:\n\n\nProgram has been completed tree generation from training data and test data classification in roughly 10 seconds.\nAccuracy on test data is 79.85 %. If we compare with ANN algorithm accuracy, which is 85.97 %, CART algorithm accuracy is worse.\nSummary\nWe have implemented one of the decision tree algorithm CART, which is able to predict categorial or numeric target variable.\nThis algorithm assembles tree data structure based on training data features by finding best question to ask for current set of data samples.\nSet of input data samples is getting smaller on every question split, so that all rows eventually get their predicted label. Once tree is built,\nwe can use it to classify new data.\nCART algorithm is easy to understand and it can be useful in certain data classification problems. This algorithm is fast and easy to train, since it does not require hyper-parameters or\nany other additional tuning techniques. It is also fast to train comparing to neural networks training efforts (GPU acceleration, lots of data, vanishing gradient).\nIf you need full project code, then check this GitHub repository:\nhttps://github.com/novakov-alexey/decision-trees\nThe entire blog-post is based on this example:\n\nYoutube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDRbO9a6XPU&amp;list=LL&amp;index=6\nPython code: https://github.com/random-forests/tutorials/blob/master/decision_tree.py\n\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/decision-tree/","title":"Decision Tree from scratch"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/delta-lake/":{"body":"\n\n\n\nChange Data Capture (CDC) is a popular technique for replication of data from OLTP to OLAP data store.\nUsually CDC tools integrate with transactional logs of relational databases and thus are mainly dedicated to replicate all possible data changes from relational databases. NoSQL databases are usually coming with built-in CDC for any possible data change (insert, update, delete), for example AWS DynamoDB Streams.\nIn this blog-post, we will look at Delta Lake table format, which supports \"merge\" operation. This operation is useful when we need to update replicated data in Data Lake.\nGenerate Data\nLet's generate some input data and merge it using Spark streaming API. Delta Lake API comes with DSL for merging data frames into into a table.\nI have prepared a Scala script which can generate CSV files with hypotetical customer orders. Every few seconds this script creates a new file which contains few hundreds of rows.\nUsing Scala CLI, run provided csv-file-gen.scala script. I am doing that within its cloned repository like this:\n\nIt will start to print a number of generates rows in a new file. 3000 is pause in milliseconds after each file generation. Do not forget to stop this script afterwards, otherwise it will generate many files on your disk, but you should keep it running if you follow me and run the code below.\nCreate Delta Table\nUsing spark-shell, or any other tools which can initiate Spark session, for example Apache Zeppelin, Jupyter, run the code below:\n\nI am using Spark 3.2.1 with Scala 2.12.15 and Java 11.0.2.\nAt this point we have a Delta table on the local file system. It is now ready for merging new changes using Spark batch or streaming queries.\nIn the above code, we are using already available generated files in data/gen/orders to create Delta Lake table itself. This is a requirement of Spark streaming API to provide input schema in advance/staticaly.\nMerge streaming data\nOur goal is to discover new files in the input directory and merge their content to a Delta Lake table. Essentially, we are going to run micro-batch processing, which allows to reference an intermediate DataFrame to merge its content to existing Delta Lake table.\n\nWe will use schema from existing ordersDf DataFrame to avoid manual schema definition, however you can also define required columns to be selected from intermiediate data frame for merge manually.\n\nOnce start method is executed, Spark starts to run a streaming job, which is going to merge all incoming data based on the primareKey orderId and its precombine key last_update_time. Precombine key is used to sort all records with the same primary key and then take the record with max(..) value. Usually, precombine key is a time-based column which can indidicate the latest transaction happened to a specific row.\nVerify merge result\nIn another spark-shell terminal we are checking that there is a maximum of 1 order per each unique orderId. If any of the orderId groups show more than 1 in the count column, then merge process is not working correctly.\n\nOutput:\n\nProoving that there are no duplicates for any order:\n\nOutput:\n\nResult is an empty dataset as expected.\nOptimization\nIf we process micro batches and merge them to Delta Lake table, then sooner or later Spark will create a lot of small Parquet files inside the table folder. Some of the files will be already obsolete and will be only needed if we query historical state of the Delta Lake table. In order to optimize table reads and writes, one should compact large number of files to get smaller number files in the table folder. Compaction can be done via standard Spark repartition operation.\nCompact files:\n\ndataChange=false is Delta's option here to minimize potential failure to other concurrent operations on the current Delta table.\nAnother way to get rid of large number of files is to run Delta's vacuum operation, which effectively removes data files older than N number of hours.\nVacuum command deletes old files which are still part of the tables, but not used when you query the latest table state. However these files are still used if you query historical state of the table. So once you vacuum old files, you loose a possibility to query those historical data after that.\nBelow example removes all histoical data by setting 0 as number of hours.\n\nDuring the compaction or vacuum you may get an exception in the running Spark streaming or batch job which can terminate your job. The reason is that both processes, i.e. main job and compact/vacuum, are trying to move table files around and thus may lead to a conflicting situations. But we remember that Delta Lake is ACID compliant, it should allow us to change data from multiple writers and still be consistent. It is still true. Delta Lake is based on optimistic concurrency principles which requires clients to retry their operations upon such failures/exceptions. If you see such a failure, then make sure you repeat the same operation again or restart Spark job upon such exceptions.\nSummary\nIn this blog-post we have seen that Delta Lake can easily merge new data to existing table via standard Spark API, in this case via streaming API.\nApart from the main opearion we need to run compaction and vacuum operations time by time as a separate houskeeping jobs to get overal better peformance when reading the table data by the main data consumers.\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/delta-lake/","title":"CDC with Delta Lake Streaming"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/face-identification/":{"body":"Face detection and recognition is one the area where Deep Learning is incredibly useful. There are many studies and datasets related to\nhuman faces and their detection/recognition. In this article we will implement Machine Learning pipeline for face detection and recognition using few libraries and CNN model.\nPipeline\nOne the part will be implemented with very popular C++ library OpenCV, which is around for a long time.\nIt has many modules for image processing, object classification, neural networks and more. We are going to use its Java Wrapper - JavaCV\nOpenCV comes with human face detector module, which is called \"Haar Cascade\" classifier.\nThis class takes an image and returns a Rect object of the detected face(s) in it. The Rect object is a data structure that has X and Y coordiantes of\nthe left-top corners plus width and height where region of interest is located. In our case, rectangular area is a face. For example:\nOriginal photo:\n\n\n\n\nCropped with Haar Cascade:\n\n\n\n\nOnce we get an area of the detected face(s), we can compare its pixel data with in advance extracted face features of known faces.\nComparison algroithm calculates a Euclidean distance between detected face vector with vectors of known faces.\nThe smallest distance with some known face sets its label as a result.\nThat means, we can take known face label that has smallest distance as a result of face identification.\nOur workflow will look like this:\n\n\n\nPhoto Preparation\nIn order to extract person features, we will prepare separate folder with image per each person:\n\nAlexey (myself)\nGuy Ritchie\nTom Araya\n\nInput directory:\n\nOutput folder:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlus I am adding my photos to dataset-people directory\n\nBelow program reads photos from the local folder and crops faces to save them to a separate folder:\n\nThe same code on GitHub is here.\nGet ONNX model\nNow we can extract face features for all three persons. We are going to use CNN model which was trained on the VGGFace dataset.\nThe easiest option to access Keras (which is Python high-level API to Tensorflow) trained model from Scala is to export it to ONNX format.\nLet's proceed:\n\nCreate SavedModel file:\n\n\nInstaniate Python VGGFace class from keras-vggface library\nwith include_top=False to skip last layer of the CNN.\nSave instaniated model to Tensforflow Tensorflow SavedModel\n\n\nImportant: we save VGGFace model without last layer. We do not need any predictions that VGGFace model originally was supposed to output,\nsince we are going to use extracted features to predict other persons than those in original VGGFace dataset.\n\nConvert saved model to ONNX format via tensorflow-onnx library\n\n\nAfter converting SavedModel to ONNX we get file data/model.onnx of approx. 56Mb in size:\nExtracting Features\nNow we can use ONNX model from Scala code. In this step, we use VGGFace model to extract features of all 3 person faces\nand save them into a file as HasMap for further step.\nFirst we implement common functions, which we will use one more time for real-time face identification algorithm:\n\nAt this point we can run extraction step:\n\nIn the extract function, we do element-wise addition of all extracted vectors per each person.\nThen, final person vector is divided by number of images for that person to get average values of the extracted features.\nIn the result we will get/define such type alias:\n\nIdentify Faces\nFinally, we can use our extracted features to identify a person face. Keep in mind, that our prediction algorithm\nknowns only 3 person faces. Any other person may be confused with one of the three known faces or they can be unknown.\nIf we want to more different people to be identifieable, we need their features as well, so go to step number one of our\npipeline to collect those people photos and extract their features.\n\nIn the main function we run infinite loop that captures video frame as an image.\nThe captured image is then used to detect and identify person faces.\n\nDemo time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I put more faces into the frame, identification algorithm may confuse some of them and identify someone with a beard as Tom Araya or someone\nwith bright white skin color as Guy Ritchie. In order to overcome such issue, you need to add more different faces.\nAlso, we would need to tune threshold parameter, which is used to discard faces which are far away from those we are interested in.\nLevel of certantity is relative of course, there can be still many people in the world who have very similar face features like Tom, Guy or me.\nSummary\nWe have made powerful application with so little code to identify some person faces. There are several libraries were used to\nget the face detection working, such as OpenCV. ONNX-Scala to access ONNX model fromm Scala.\nBorer library to save and load face features as Scala object (HashMap) into memory from disk.\nCurrent approach to identify faces by calculating Euclidian distance between input faces and pre-calculated face is not the only one.\nWe could also train custom CNN or VGGFace-based model with new layer to predict labels for Tom, Guy and myself.\nHowever, such approach is compute intensive and actually gave me quite bad results.\nIf you know something crucial about this approach to work well, please let me know.\nOther approaches to solve face identification task which you may want to get familiar with are\nTriplet Loss function and Siamese Networks.\nPerhaps, I will try one of them next time.\nLinks\nYou can find complete project code at GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/novakov-alexey/face-identification/tree/main/src/main/scala\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/face-identification/","title":"Face Identification with VGGFace and OpenCV"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/flink-ml/":{"body":"If you want to add Machine Learning capabilities into your Flink job then this article is for you.\nAs Flink runs on Java Virtual Machine, we are constrained by the tools which JVM supports. However, there are still plenty of options to choose in order to perform model training and inference as part of a Flink job.\n\n\n\nSupervised Machine Learning\nBefore we dive into Flink specifics to apply Machine Learning, let's first define key points of Supervised Machine Learning.\nIn Supervised Machine Learning we feed data into the algorithm containing the right answers.\nThen we check whether the algorithm can eventually learn those answers on its own by feeding new or test data. That means we supervise the algorithm until we reach desired model performance in terms of accuracy, error rate and other metrics.\nTraining phase is usually done on a batch data iteratively. In other words, our training data set is already prepared and stored on disk in one\nor multiple files. Flink can read all of those files in streaming or batch mode.\nHowever, it does not make sense much to use streaming mode, because streaming job will start to poll for additional files on disk and won't terminate on its own,\nunless special Flink configuration is set such like \"streaming - bounded\" mode to facilitate natural job termination.\nThe same approach would be applicable for a message queue as a training data source, where data set would be a sequence of messages, which we need to read all to eventually train the model.\nThere is another approach when ML model is trained on so called \"online data\", i.e. it reads real-time data continuously and also updates model weights as part of the training.\nThis process ideally never ends, because it is part of the production application. That means we train the model and use it to score real data in parallel.\nMost common approach in Supervised Machine Learning these days is training on offline data in batch mode.\nIn this blog post we will focus on this approach specifically. We will use Flink batch jobs to read prepared data and run training cycle to get the trained model.\nOnce trained model is ready, it will be stored on disk and then can be loaded by another job to do model inference as part of the application logic.\nData Streaming and ML\nLet's quickly define basic definitions for training and inference to build up further concepts on top of them:\nModel Training:\n\nIt is iterative process which runs on the finite dataset\nTraining is usually done on schedule (once per hour or day or week, i.e. depends on data updates)\nIf training is done on online data, then the training loop repeats infinitely and updates internal model weights on every record or window / mini-batch\n\nModel Inference:\n\nIt is a call of a math function like \"y = model(x)\", where x is feature vector and y is prediction vector.\n\nIn streaming mode: a call on every input record\nIn batch mode: a call for entire mini-batch at once\n\n\n\nBoth definitions above are true for Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning.\nModel re-training and updates\nOnce model is trained and stored on disk, it may become outdated very soon. Of course, it depends whether our environment may get new\ndata to learn something new from it. In many business domains, data does not change fast, so we can train a model and use it for many days or months without\nre-training it again.\nIn order to update a model in the running Flink job, we have several options:\nFor cases when Flink job calls a model inside JavaVM or PythonVM:\n\nRestart Flink job loading newer model (for cases when ML model is loaded on job startup).\nRefresh ML model version in memory periodically or on some event. This option minimizes Flink job downtime.\n\nFor cases when Flink calls a model using remote procedure call (RPC), i.e. over the network, the\nFlink job restart is not needed, but that external service may lead to the Flink job outage or temporary failures, when the external service is restarted.\nIn order to mitigate external service outage or achieve zero-time outage for the Flink side, a DevOps team in charge can apply different techniques such as:\n\nBlue-Green deployments for the external service to serve the latest and previous model version in the same time\nAdditionally, configure a network load balancer to automatically switch to a new model version once it is up and running.\n\nML Libraries for Flink\nAs a Flink developer you might have a question - can we easily do ML training in Flink? Can it be also done with the popular ML libraries like Scikit-Learn, Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc.?\nThe answer to the first question is yes, we can do ML tasks in Flink. As for the second question we can also answer as yes, however it does not make sense to run training of Scikit-Learn based model in Flink, if it is not\nintegrated with Flink runtime and its job operators. That said, we can't easily leverage Flink distributed runtime to run training process efficiently.\nIdeally we want to use all Flink cluster task managers. Certain tasks in ML training can still benefit from Flink runtime. For example, training with cross-validation (different training and test data set splits).\nwhere every data split would be run on its own Flink task if we submit all splits concurrently. If no cross validation is used, then we will be running training on a single task within a single task manager.\nThus, this neglects the whole idea to use Flink runtime for training as it will be underutilized and will bring a lot of extra work for a developer without giving benefits.\nThat said, the idea to use Flink without low-level integration of Flink tasks and operators with specific external library does not worth it.\nIt would be the same effect as we training ML model without Flink runtime, but directly on some VMs running ML programs sequentially or in parallel for different data set splits.\nThe good news is Flink has its own ML module called Flink ML. Flink ML supports training and model inference.\nIt fully utilizes Flink tasks to distribute training process within a Flink cluster. Of course, Flink ML module limits us by only those ML algorithms, which it supports at the moment.\nAs of today, it is quite rich list of supported ML algorithms including typical data preparation algorithms, for example data normalization.\nExternal Libraries\nWhen it comes to other libraries, which are coming from Python or C world, we can only use them in Flink to do a model inference.\nIn order to load a model produced by external library, we either use available JVM SDK of that library or we can also use PyFlink and load any Python-based model.\nIf our ML library has C/C++ interface, then we can also use JVM language wrappers for those libraries, for example libtorch has Scala wrapper storch.\nIn this case native library will be used via Java Native Interface.\nWays to do ML in Flink\nLet's look at the table below with all options we have to apply Machine Learning in Flink:\nLibrary Name / ApproachNative Training SupportInference SupportRemark\nFlink MLxxEasy to use. Most common algorithms are supported\nDeep Learning on Flink: Tensorflow, Pytorch integrationxxAllows to train inside a Flink cluster. Caveat: this community project requires dependency upgrades\nJVM runtimes for model formats like PMML, ONNX  (ex: onnx-scala, flink-jpmml)xFast and generic way\nPython libraries via Flink Table API (UDF)xAny Python library can be used, but it can be slow due to the PythonVM itself and data exchange\nScala wrappers for C/C++ libraries (libtorch, etc.)xToday is mainly limited to Pytorch or Tensorflow\n\nEmpty table cell above means we train a model outside of Flink, e.g. in any other programming language.\nGeneric ML Workflow with Flink\nBelow workflows use Flink at the Inference phase only (right side). In the most common situation, development teams establish their training pipelines outside of Flink using external libraries.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Training and Inference workflows with and w/o Flink\nTraining\nIn the Training phase we run an application, which (1) reads data from disk, object storage or consumes a set of data from messaging system like Apache Kafka. This application can be a Flink job which uses FlinkML module or some other ML Framework via PyFlink. The ML application can (2) consume data in mini-batches\nor read it record by record.\nWhile running a training loop, the application updates current model weights in memory and (3) stores them periodically to a persistent storage (file system, object storage like AWS S3). Training loop usually runs dozen of times until it reaches certain thresholds of the training metrics and some other control conditions.\nInference\nIn the Inference phase we run Flink Job which may or may not share some code with the training job.\nThe main point is that the inference Flink job loads already trained model and uses the same ML framework to call the model. At the beginning, inference job reads (1) data similarly to the training job, but this time it reads unseen data to (2) apply ML model and stores the results to the sink system. Usually the results are stored on every record to (3) messaging system or some persistent storage.\nFlink ML Module\nIn this blog we uncover Flink ML module and look at its applications. In the next blog posts we look at further ways for ML tasks in Flink such as ONNX, PyFlink and C/C++ wrappers.\nFlink ML module supports training and inference for the most popular supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms.\nThis module uses Flink job primitives to build a distributed graph of operators to perform model training or inference.\nML job runs in distributed mode utilizing all available Flink task managers in the cluster.\nFlink ML algorithms are implemented as operators. You can see them in the Flink UI when opening job graph visualization. Flink's Table API is a basis for Flink ML. It uses Table type to represent input and output data.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Flink Job graph of LogisticRegression model training and validation.\nAbove figure shows a large Flink Job graph from the Flink UI, which is built by Flink Table API and Flink ML to run data preparation and Logistic Regression training process.\nWe will see how to train such a model in details further.\nAlgorithms supported by the FlinkML\nTaskAlgorithms\nClassificationK-Nearest Neighbor, Linear SVC, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes\nClusteringAgglomerativeClustering, Kmeans\nRecommendationSwing\nRegressionLinear Regression\nStatisticsChiSqTest\nEvaluationBinary Classification, Evaluator\nFeature EngineeringNormalizer, Scalers, Binarizer  and many others\nStatsChiSqTest\n\nExample: Logistic Regression\nLet's implement an ML application in Flink for Customer Churn Analysis by using Flink ML's Logistic Regression algorithm. This use case is quite typical task for enterprises which want to find  unhappy customers and offer better conditions to retain them.\nThe goal of our model is to predict whether a customer may leave a bank or not.\nAs clients data, we use syntetic data set prepared and stored in CSV file format in local filesystem.\nClients data has all required columns to train the ML model.\nData Preparation\nBelow is the data sample in CSV format which we will use by the training job:\n\nFor our application we skip irrelevant columns such as RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname and use all other columns (features) of this dataset:\n\nColumn Exited is our target label to predict. It contains binary value such as 0 or 1, which encodes the following logic:\n\n0 - client won't exit the bank;\n1 - client will exit the bank\n\nBefore we feed the selected data columns into the any ML algorithm, we need to transform this data\ninto numerical format. At this point we start to name data columns as features. Categorical features\nshould be encoded with one-hot encoder, numerical features also known as continues features should be normalized. Specific data encoding and\nnormalization is needed to achieve the highest model accuracy and the lowest error rate during the training or simply saying this helps to achieve the best\nlearning performance in terms quality.\nTo learn more on feature engineering topic I advise you to read special literature on that. In this blog post we focus on Flink ML module itself.\nLoad CSV as Flink Table\nFirst we use Flink DataStream API to load tabular CSV data from file and parse it into the Row type.\n\ntrainData is the input data to our data preprocessing step.\nPrepare ML Features\n\nStringIndexer turns string (categorical) columns into integer-indexed columns.\nFor each Country and for both Genders we will have an integer value from 0 to N, where N is a number of unique values in the column.\nIn case of country column, N is 3 as we have 3 countries in the data set.\n\nOneHotEncoder creates an additional column per each unique category in the original column.\nOutput columns \"Geography\" will be divided into 3 columns and \"Gender\" into 2 columns.\nThat means we get 5 columns instead of these 2 original columns in the resulting table.\nOther feature columns so far stay unchanged.\nMerge to a Vector column\nBefore we normalize continues features, we need to merge individual columns into a single column.\nThat means the resulting column will look like:\n\n\nBy merging these columns into a single column, we prepare training data for the final stage of the training pipeline, which is LogisticRegression model.\nIts input format requires to fit a single column with all features per row.\nNormalize Numbers and Merge Columns\n\n\nStandardScaler transforms a column values using column mean and standard deviation values.\nVectorAssembler merges all input columns into one single column, which we name as features.\n\nThe resulting table format will have two columns:\n\nTrain the Model\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Model riding the train\nNow we combine all stages and train the model:\n\nOur training pipeline consists of data preparation stages and LogisticRegression evaluator.\nLogisticRegression as the last stage is going to keep and train model weights.\nMethod fit executes the training loop. Input data goes through all the stages sequentially.\nThe pipelineModel variable is a trained model which we use further to assess its quality by calculating several metrics.\nValidate the Model\n\nIn the result, above calculation will print all the validate set rows with their predictions and final accuracy metric value:\n\nAmong 2000 validate set rows we got 1619 correctly labeled, which is 81% correctness of the trained model.\nOne more useful evaluation of the model performance is to use Flink ML\nBinaryClassificationEvaluator:\n\nWe get the following values:\n\nWe are not going to try to improve current metrics and overall model performance. That would be a subject for another blog post.\nSave and Load Model\nIf we need to save learned model weights and then later load them again, Flink ML has special methods for that:\nSave Model data:\n\nDo not forget to call execute method to trigger model saving at the specified path.\nIn the result we will get the following metadata and data on disk:\n\nLoad Model data:\n\nFlink ML Summary\nIn result we were able to create a Flink job which can learn and train ML model for Customer Churn Analysis using LogisticResgression algorithm.\nAs part of the learning process, we were able to  prepare data in the proper format using Flink ML encoders and scalers utilities.\nIn case we want to use the trained model further, we can store and load its state in the same or in a completely new Flink job.\nThis allows us to train ML models in Flink on a specific environment and use them later in production.\nFlink ML also allows to extend it with own ML algorithm using FlinkML API.\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/flink-ml/","title":"Machine Learning with Flink"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/flink-model-formats/":{"body":"The most popular eco-system to train ML model these days is Python and C/C++ based libraries. An example of model training can be a Logistic Regression algorithms, from ScikitLearn package or\nmore advanced neural networks algorithms offered by Tensorflow, Pytorch and others. There are lots of tools and libraries in Python world to facilitate training and model serving.\nIn order to bring trained models in Keras or SciKitLean into a Flink application, we can use cross-platform file formats such as ONNX and PMML (in the past). These formats also come with language runtimes.\nIn Flink case, we select JVM SDK to run inference logic inside the Flink job.\nLet's look at the example on how to train Logistic Regression in Python using Keras and then use trained model in ONNX format inside Flink.\n\n\n\nTraining in Python\nWe will use the same Machine Learning task of Custom Churn Analysis as we did in the first blog post \"Machine Learning with Flink\".\nIn order to train Logistic Regression algorithm in Python we will use Keras (part of Tensorflow library) to train simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\nand store it to disk. Then, we will use tf2onnx Python package to convert Tensorflow saved_model to ONNX format.\nWe have already prepared Git repository to clone and get the trained ONNX model. Follow below instructions:\nGitHub Repository: https://github.com/novakov-alexey/tf-onnx-customer-churn\n\nClone the Git repository.\n\n\n\nCreate Python environment via:\n\n\n\nInstall Python packages via:\n\n\n\nTrain and save model to disk via:\n\n\n\nFinally, export into ONNX:\n\n\nIn result, we get a model in the ONNX format under models/model.onnx file path. We will use it in the next step.\nInference in Flink\nNow we are almost ready to use trained model and run inference for the live data.\nHowever, there is one caveat in data preparation which we need take care of.\nWhile training ANN in Python we encoded input raw data using SciKitLearn package: categorical features were one-hot encoded, then all columns were\nscaled as per their mean and standard deviation. This data preparation logic is part of feature engineering and sometimes called as feature extraction.\nWe need either repeat this code in the Flink job or apply it somewhere in upstream data flow before the Flink job gets triggered.\nTo summarize the whole process we can describe end-to-end flow in the following way:\nTraining Part:\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Model training in Python\nInference Part:\nOption 1 - Feature extraction is implemented again:\nIn Option 1., we use own code inside the Flink job to transform raw data into feature vectors which we can feed directly into the ML model to get predictions.\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Data Preparation in Flink job itself\nOption 2 - The same Python script acts as pre-processor:\nIn Option 2. we use the same code which was used during the training process. Python app is running as non-Flink app which prepares and stores data in the vector format.\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Data Preparation in Python before the Flink job\nAs you can see we have to either duplicate feature extraction logic in Flink job (option 1.) or reuse a part of training Python script just to extract features\nfrom live data and pass it further to the Flink job.\nIn this blog post we select Option 1. just demonstrate that standard feature extraction algorithm is\nnot hard to implement in Flink itself. Downside of this option is that we repeat ourselves which makes overall workflow maintenance\nmore labor intensive or even error-prone, if this logic is not synchronized between both phases.\nIf we imagine that this common logic would be stored in different repositories or handled by different\ndevelopment teams, then Option 2. would be preferable.\nJob Implementation\nFeature Extraction\nThis part we will implement in Flink ML and reuse some parts of the code from the first blog post about Flink ML.\n\nAbove we define a schema of CSV file which will be used to train feature extractors such as encoder and scaler.\nThis extra-training is going to be done only once on the job start time. For the faster start up we can also save the featureExtractor state\non disk and load it on job start instead of training it every time.\n\nWorking with ONNX model\nIn order to load and call ONNX model in JVM we will use ONNX Runtime library inside our Flink job:\n\nThe model inference is wrapped into the Flink RichMapFunction:\n\nMapFunction loads model in memory and creates a session object to be able to run model inference in map method on every input event.\nThe features parameter represents a feature vector of the source record.\nLive Data\nAs live data we will use just a sample of CSV data taken from the initial CSV file. However, the source type can be in any other form including Kafka, JDBC or other file formats.\nInference job also does not care if this job graph will be executed in streaming or batch mode, so we can decide any time whether this job needs to be continuously running or\njust applied for a prepared data set in batch mode.\n\nJob Graph Execution\nNow we are ready to stitch all pieces together and execute the Flink job graph:\n\nJob graph combines together Table API source table and DataStream map functions.\nIn the first map we cast table row to the appropriate input of the CustomerChurnClassifier. The last one runs the model inference and prints the prediction result into the\nconsole. That row casting is unfortunate price from using Table API and crossing the boundaries to use the DataStream API further. Alternatively we could try\nto implement inference logic using Table API as User-Defined-Function (UDF).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4. Overall Flink job graph\n\n\n\nFigure 5. Bottom part of the Flink job graph with focus on inference\nAbove Flink job graph shows quite a lot tasks. This is because the feature extraction is done with Flink ML which schedules every internal operation as a task.\nThis is quite useful when we deal with a lot data, so that we can process it very fast. The are 6 tasks running highlighted in the red shape.\nThey are responsible for the model inference. All other 21 tasks on top are Flink ML tasks are scheduled for training of the feature extraction operators.\nThese tasks transition to finished state quite fast, as encoders gets trained within 10 seconds based on the training data set of 10k rows we used.\nThe entire code of the Flink job using ONNX format model is published in Git repository:\nflink-onnx\nSummary\nAs Flink Developers, we can easily embed ML models into our Flink jobs in format like ONNX.\nThis allows us to train ML algorithms in any language/platform we want, including Python.\nOne important point to think in advance is the feature extraction.\nArchitects should decide how to implement feature extraction logic once and reuse it everywhere: training and inference.\nEmbedding ML models inside the Flink job allows us to avoid any network latency comparing with alternative approach when an ML model is served as a service via HTTP/RPC API.\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/flink-model-formats/","title":"ONNX Model format in Flink "},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/flink-scala3/":{"body":" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have come here,  then you probably know that current version of Apache Flink 1.16 Scala API still depends\non Scala 2.12. However, the good news is that previous Flink release 1.15 introduced an important change\nfor Scala users, which allows us to use own Scala version via Flink Java API. That means users can now use Scala 2.13 or 3 to write Flink jobs.\nEarlier, Flink had Scala 2.12 as a mandatory library on application classpath, so one could not use newer version due to version conflicts.\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Flink Scala API will be still available in future, but will probably be deprecated at some point. It is unclear at this point.\nFlink community made a decision to not engage with newer Scala version and make Flink to be Scala-free, in terms of user's Scala version choice.\nWhether it is good or bad for Scala users in general we will going to see in near future. Definitely this choice is good, as it unlocks\nFlink for newer Scala versions.\n\nFor those who wants to use Scala 2.13 or Scala 3 with Flink already today, there are few options available:\n\nflink-scala-api a fork of Flink Scala bindings originally done by Findify\nFlink4s\n\nFurther example in this blog-post is using first option, i.e. flink-scala-api.\nBuild Job with Scala 3\nWe are going to create custom Flink Docker image, which can run Scala 3 streaming jobs based on Flink 15.2 version.\nDocker and containers are used to easily reproduce this example on any environment, however they are not mandatory for Scala 3 usage in general.\nFirst, clone novakov-alexey/flink-sandbox Git repository, which is using SBT to build an example Flink job.\nSo SBT needs to be installed as well.

Such new resource would describe everything in\none single type which would require 5-10 separate native Kubernetes resources.\n\nGood news is that such custom resource creation is possible in Kubernetes, however who would be processing such custom resources?\nThe answer is the Custom Controller would process such new custom resources and this is official way that Kubernetes allows its users\nto extend Kubernetes API-Server:\n\nkind: CustomResourceDefinition, apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1\nCustom Controller, which is dedicated program running usually inside the Kubernetes cluster\n\nOperator Pattern\nCustom Controller is also called Kubernetes Operator. Operator became a design pattern to automate application deployment operations by\nrunning custom program, which will deploy Kubernetes native resources based on code logic. So you can say that the Operator pattern\nis a next level of automation, which DevOps applies to Kubernetes. Of course, you could also go with Helm package manager\nand deploy/change your set of native resources via command like helm update. However, that requires a full-time engineer to sit and perform such operations by hands.\nOperator workflow can be illustrated as the following 3 steps:\n\n\n\n\n\nUser creates new custom resource instance via Kubernetes API, for example using kubectl CLI\nOnce custom resource is created, this event is sent to custom controller, since the last one is subscribed to custom resource type updates\nOnce custom controller got the event it automatically executes one or multiple CRUD commands towards API server\n\nLater, users can modify or delete custom resources like any other native resources. Custom controller will handle these events as well. Based\non its programmed logic it decides what to do in case of custom resource modification or deletion. Custom controller can watch for native resources as well, there are no restrictions to that.\nUse Case: Kerberos Operator\nLet's look at how to develop new operator from scratch in Scala using Kubernetes-Client library.\nOur desired custom resources are going to be the following:\nKrbServer\n\nPrincipals\n\nBased on above resource example, our operator will eventually create/modify/delete the following native resources:\n\nService to expose Kerberos server\nPod to launch Kerberos container\nSecrets to keep Kerberos principal keytabs or their credentials\n\nOperator will have native resource templates in its code to apply them when it gets custom resource instance. Such native template will be\nused to create native resources based on values available in custom resources. So that we get logical\nmapping between particular custom resource instance and its set of native resources, which user expects to create/modify/delete in Kubernetes namespace(s).\n\n\n\nImplementation\nLibraries\nBelow are the main Scala libraries to implement new operator app:\n\nResource Model\nCustom resource specification is modeled as a hierarchy of Scala case classes:\n\nIn the result, we get two custom resources: Princpals and KrbServer. Each of them has a status property such as PrincipalsStatus\nand KrbServerStatus accordingly. Status property of the custom resource is additional way to communicate from an operator to a user who is going\nto submit CR instances and changes to them. Structure of status property can have anything in it what operator author decides to have.\nBoth statuses and main CR specifications are validated according to operator provided OpenAPI JSON schema. Basically, operator author provided a JSON schema when operator is installed.\nOperators can also install CRD automatically. In order to allow that, a service account used by operator has to have a special RBAC permissions.\nOperator Main Class\nLet's import the following classes into the operator main class:\n\nIn the operator main class, we will instantiate Kubernetes client and start watching for KrbServer and Principalas custom resources.\n\nWatching Resource\nKubernetes-Client library is brings FS2 library as a direct dependency to watch for the Kubernetes resources. That gives a lot of power\nto handle events in fault-tolerant way. Also, FS2 nicely composes with Cats-Effect.\n\nAbove code opens long-term HTTP connection to Kubernetes API-Server, which is going to listen for custom resource updates. Until this connection is not closed by the\noperator or by the API-Server, operator will receive and pass custom resource events containing current resource state to a function called handler. Its output\nwill be passed further to submitStatus function. These two functions will be called on every event sent by API-Server to the watching operator. Now, our goal is to\nreact to these events and make something to happen in Kubernetes cluster. In our case, we need to create Kerberos pod, service and a bunch of secrets.\nAlso, our Principals resource means that principal list must be registered in Kerberos database using one of the Kerberos process called KDC. If you never worked with\nKerberos, then think of it like a database, which we need to deploy to Kubernetes and create new users with requested credentials. Later, someone\nwill mount newly created secrets with keytabs to some user's Pod and will going to authenticate to Kerberos via keytab file. Keytab is something like\npassword saved into a binary file with additional meta information.\nHandler Function\nWe are coming closer to processing the custom resource events. Below is a FS2 Pipe to take CustomResource type and return optional status.\nwhich is going to be added to the copy of original custom resource event. Then, we take this optional status and pass to the next function to submit it to API-Server.\n\nIn the above match statement, we call different methods of a controller object, which will define right now:\n\nAs you might noticed, main class has word Operator in it. Event handlers are called controllers.\nBasically, our entire application will be called operator. However, this operator app has internal logic wrapped into Controller class.\nIn our case, we will have two controllers, each handles own custom resource such as KrbServer and Principals.\nSubmit Status\nBelow submitStatus function is to add status value and submit it back to API-Server:\n\nWatchers and Reconcillers\nWe need to create a pair of watchers and return them to Cats IOApp to launch the entire application.\nWe are almost ready to define run method of the IOApp:\n\nBefore starting our watchers we check whether our CRDs are already registered in API-Server. If they are not, then make an attempt to register\nby our operator:\n\nIf operator failed to create a CRD, then it crashes the entire application, because it won't be able to open a watcher connection later for non-existing CRD.\nFinally, let's look what reconcile function is doing:\n\nIt calls every 30 seconds the API-Server to list all existing CR instances of a specific custom resource type. Then every instance in the list is checked\nwhether its state is correctly handled according to business logic of the operator.\nMain idea of reconciliation loop is to have a chance to recover from failures, which may occur in the main handler stream.\nFinish\nAt this point we have all pieces, which can be used to implement any operator. Just plug in your own controller's logic.\nIn our case here, the main business logic is hidden in these classes:\n\nFull source of working operator can be found here: https://github.com/novakov-alexey/krb-operator2\nSummary\nWe have created an operator skeleton in Scala using Kubernetes-Client, which can be used to build any other operator.\nThanks to Cats-Effect and FS2 we can handle custom resource event stream easily composing functions.\nKubernetes Operator is a dedicated application which automates deployment of complex stateful and stateless applications.\nSuch application can be implemented in any language since API-Server is exposing custom resource via REST API using JSON payloads.\nThere is no need to have special operator framework or library to enable developers to create new operators easily. Just have a show case app\nlike we have developed and re-use its code to start another operator when needed. Basically, what is actually needed is a decent Kubernetes client\nlibrary like the one we used and you are good to go.\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/k8s-operator/","title":"Kubernetes Operator in Scala for Kerberos Keytab Management"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/linear-regression/":{"body":"In this article we are going to use Scala mini-library for Deep Learning\nthat we developed earlier in order to study basic linear regression task.\nWe will learn model weights using perceptron model, which will be our single unit network layer that emits target value.\nThis model will predict a target value yHat based on two trained parameters: weight and bias. Both are scalar numbers.\nWeights optimization is going to be based on implemented Gradient descent algorithm:\n\nGradient Descent Optimization\nTraining Loop\n\nModel equation:\n\nData Preparation\nOur goal is to show that perceptron model can learn the parameters, so that we can generate fake data using\nuniformly distributed random generator:\n\nWe have just prepared two datasets: 8000 data samples for train and 2000 samples for test cycles.\nModel Training\nFirst, we initialise sequential model for just one dense layer with single unit which is going to be a perceptron model.\n\nIn order to avoid exploding gradient values, we also set grading clipping value, so that whenever our gradient is not\nin -5;5 numeric range it will be clipped to left or right boundary accordingly.\nLet's start training and see if real weight and bias which we used to generate fake data are learnt by the\nperceptron:\n\nOutput:\n\nI have cut the middle part of the output, but it is not hard to see the progress.\nLatest model weights:\n\nOriginal/true weights we used for data generation:\n\nNumers are quite close to true numbers, but not exactly the same.\nI have set small/slow learningRate as 0.00005f by intention, so that our learning metrics\nwill be smoother on the future plots. If we set learningRate to bigger value, it will be\ncloser to true weights.\nWhen I write weights I often mean bias and weight parameters in the same time.\nTest dataset\nWe have 2000 data samples for model testing, let's what the error on predicting target values using unseen data:\n\nLoss value on test is quite close to training loss, so the learnt model is fine and we can continue:\n\nVisualization\nTo visualize the loss function, I have decied to try Picta library.\nIt can be used in Jupyter notebook via Almond Scala kernel, which is very cool.\nBefore we try to use Picta's 2D or 3D Canvas API,\nwe need to prepare metrics data.\nWe could run the entire training code in Jupyter together with Picta around, but as of now Almond Scala kernel\ndoes not support Scala 3 which was used to write the Deep Learning code. So we will go with CSV files to\nbridge two worlds.\nThis is our plan:\n\nStore metrics data from existing Scala 3 code to CSV files\nUse CVS files in Jupyter with Scala 2.13\n\nData points vs. Model\nSaving data points and gradient history, i.e. weight and bias during the training:\n\nstore function is just creating a CSV file out of data in the Scala list:\n\nLet's plot data points that we used to train the model as well the line that is based on learnt model parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur model crosses the data points almost in the middle as expected.\nLoss metric per epoch\nCreating a CSV file that contains loss value per training epoch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss Function Surface &amp; Gradient History\nPicta can also draw 3D plots, so that we can generate loss surface based on weight and bias parameters (x and y axis) and loss value as z axis.\n\n\nLast column is going to be used in 3D plot as Z axis. It is a list rather than a scalar value. This way we can draw\na surface in Picta later.\n\nSecond plot gradient is for gradient history.\nI have created several print-screens just to show you this beatiful surface from different angles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDotted line is gradient descent trace: z axis is loss value which is moving to the local minimum with every epoch.\nIt is moving according to its w and b, which are plotted on x and y axis accordingly.\nContour Chart\nOne more fancy chart from Picta is contour chart, which sometimes can be useful for analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust for you to prove that this was drawn in Jupyter actually :-)\n\n\n\n\nAgain big thanks to Almond project that made Scala easily runnable in Jupyter.\nSummary\nWe have seen that our perceptron model is able to learn weights very quick for simple 1 input variable.\nSo it proves that gradient descent algorithm implemented earlier is working fine.\nAlso, we could visualise loss metrics using Picta and Almond Jupyter kernel for Scala quite easily.\nSuch visualisation can help us to tune model training in real life use cases.\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/linear-regression/","title":"Linear Regression with Gradient Descent"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/presentations/":{"body":"\n\n\n2025\n\n31.08.2025 JVM Day 2025: Особенности разработки Flink джобов на Scala Slides\n\n2024\n\n22.11.2024 BigData Europe 2024: Streamhouse Architecture with Flink and Paimon Slides\n21.10.2024 Flink Forward 2024: Deep Dive - Bridging Data Silos with Flink CDC Announce\n27.03.2024 Ververica Webinar: Hop to it!

It is written in Scala and can compile, build artefacts for Scala and Java projects. SBT is also the first build\ntool in the Scala eco-system and the most used one among Scala developers. I am using SBT already for many years and found the following useful plugins which I use in most of my projects:\nGiter8\nIt allows to create an SBT project template to ramp up new SBT project. Project template usually includes typical configuration that\nan SBT user copies and pastes from a project to project. User can put any file into a template.\nOne part of the Giter8 is embedded into SBT. The second part is the Giter8 plugin itself. User can create new SBT project from template hosted at GitHub and that the most useful part. You just need an internet access, then run SBT new command. For example:\n\nscalaboot.g8 is a name of the GitHub repository at my personal account novakov-alexey. SBT converts template name into\nhttps://github.com/novakov-alexey/scalaboot.g8 path, which you can visit in browser as well. There is also an option to use Giter8 template from the local file system.\nOnce we run above command, Giter8 creates new project file structure such as:\n\nTemplate File Structure\nProject template is also an SBT project :-). In case of scalaboot.g8 example, it looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nContent of the g8 folder is a template content which will be used when users apply this template\nfor their projects. Giter8 template supports properties and special syntax for them. Properties can\nbe put at any place of your template. Let's look at the example in build.sbt file:\n\nA text between $ ... $ is evaluated by Giter8 and replaced by pre-defined or user-given parameters.\nIn my scalaboot template, I have following pre-defined values:\nsrc/main/g8/default.properties\n\nSBT new command is going through the list of defined properties and sets the default values in case\nusers do not provide their own values. In the example below, I apply scalaboot template for\nproject name app-1. I also set my project description and newer Scala version. They will appear in the build.sbt:\n\nSBT Revolver\nIt is simple plugin to be added in a Scala project. However, Giter8 is not necessarily to be added in your project, only when you\ndevelop new template and want to keep it in the GitHub repo. Revolver plugin can be added to project as any other user plugin via project/plugins.sbt file.\nAdding its definition to that file:\n\nChange x.y.z to latest version from its GitHub repository.\nMain feature of sbt-reolver is \"triggered execution\" upon project file modification.\nIt helps to restart your application automatically and may remind\nyou dynamic-language experience where developers test their modules by refreshing a browser page or by calling their scripts again.\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, it enables a super-fast development turnaround for your Scala applications.\nSBT Reolver starts your application in forked JVM, that helps to easily pass JVM options and restart it again upon triggered execution.\n\n\n\n\nMainExchange is my Scala application started by sbt-revolver as separate JVM process.\nRevolver has its own configuration to control JVM options, environment variables, etc.\nJVM options example:\n\nSet your main class. It is useful when you have more than one:\n\nEnable debug of the forked JVM process:\n\nExport environment variables for your Scala application:\n\nBelow is an example of starting an application via sbt-revolver:\n\n\n\n\nMainExchange is Akka-HTTP based application running HTTP server. Now let us change some line of code in the code base.\nOnce we done that, sbt-revolver immediately triggers compilation, stop running process and starts new one:\n\n\n\n\nThere are 3 things happened:\n\nBuild triggered (compilation)\nStop running application\nStart new application\n\nrestart revolver SBT task is leveraging SBT triggered execution which is enabled by tilde ~ in front the task name,\nwhen running it in SBT shell.\nThere are other useful commands to be combined with ~ to trigger some task upon files modification:\n\nSBT Tpolecat\nEnables Scala compiler options as per recommendations of Rob Norris blog-post. Plugin enables as many Scala compiler options as possible to enforce type safety and\ndiscourage bad practises in the code base by turning warnings into compiler errors.\nAdd plugin to your project:\n\nActually, the same compiler options can be enabled manually within the SBT definition. However, it is more convenient to\nenable this plugin once and forget about adding anything manually. One can also disable particular options enabled by this\nplugin, in case that option does not make sense for particular project.\nSome of the options which are enabled by this plugin:\n\nLast time I checked this plugin it enables 54 scalac options. I recommend to use this plugin by default in every project, it will\nmake your code base much more robust.\nSBT Native Packager\nTo enbale in your project:\n\nNative Packager allows to package your application in different formats such as:\n\nuniversal&nbsp;zip, tar.gz,&nbsp;xz&nbsp;archives\ndeb&nbsp;and&nbsp;rpm&nbsp;packages\ndmg&nbsp;\nmsi&nbsp;\nDocker\nGraalVM&nbsp;native images\n\nNative packager is not auto-plugin, i.e. it is not enabled by default. In order to use it for some of\nyour module, you need to enable it in SBT definition:\n\nThis plugins comes with different types of packaging format, which you can choose when enabling it for some SBT module.\nIn the example above, we enable Java packaging format with Ash shell compatible executable script, so that we can run a JAR file\nin Alpine Linux. Basically, JavaAppPackaging is a base format. It creats a couple of scripts to start JVM with a long list\nof JAR files in the CLASSPATH variable. It also puts all required dependencies into the lib folder,\nwhich is referenced from that automatically generated shell script.\nJava Packaging Format\nBelow an example of such SBT task. It builds a universal ZIP archive:\n\nit will create a ZIP archive with a file structure shown below:\n\nbin/exchange is a shell script to run your Scala application Main class.\nDocker Image format\nSBT task to create a Dockerfile and the same file structure as for Java packaging format:\n\n\nIn order to build an image and publish it to a container registry:\n\nYou can also customise Dockerfile, which is by default generated automatically.\nDefault docker file content can be be seen via:\n\nIn order to customize Dockerfile content you can set your sequence of Dockerfile commands:\n\nSometimes I use only Java packaging part of this plugin and build Docker image directly via docker build command\nto avoid new SBT start. It is usually done, when image build is designed as separate step in CI pipeline.\nSBT Release\nSBT Release provides customisable release process. It helps to manage your project version, publish project artefacts to configured\nrepository.\n\nTypical Scala project release process may include:\n\n\n\n\nYou can script all typical tasks to perform version increase, creating Git tag, building an image, publishing\na JAR file to central artefact repository, etc. SBT Release gives a list of predefined tasks, which we\ncan use as is or customise to fulfil project needs.\nDefault list of release steps is:\n\nDefault list can be good enough for typical Scala project. You do not need to define it in SBT build file if you are fine\nwith it.\nIn order to run SBT tasks to release with default steps, one can run:\n\nSome of the steps are responsible for project version management. Project version is usually located in project root folder and named\nas version.sbt file.\nIn case we have such version in the file:\n\nthen\n\ninquireVersions step will read it\nsetReleaseVersion step will make as release version\n\n\n\nsetNextVersion step will switch release version to next snapshot version\n\n\nVersion increment can be customised, so that you can control which number is incremented: patch, minor or major version.\nThere are steps to commit and push changes, typically placed at the end of the process.\nIf we look at Git log after release is executed, then we will see that sbt-release is making a couple of commits to reflect\nthe release process in Git commit history.\nLatest message on top:\n\nOther useful plugins\nThere are many other useful plugins I usually use from project to project:\n\nsbt-updates to report newest versions of the libraries inlucluded in your project.\nsbt-scalafmt to format Scala code.\nsbt-mdoc to compile Scala code snippets in the Markdown documentation. Useful for own Scala libraries.\nsbt-scoverage to report test coverage in the project.\n\nSummary\nSBT has become quite mature build tool. It offers good variety of plugins for every day life of Scala developer.\nIf you cannot find specific SBT plugin that fits your requirements, you can try to implement it using SBT Tasks and Plugin API.\nThen it could be published as open source project. This is how many SBT plugins were born.\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/sbt-plugins/","title":"SBT Plugins"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-ce-timeout/":{"body":"\n\n\n\nSometimes Scala developer needs to call external program, which is running outside of the JVM.\nIn this case, we use scala.sys.process package. Process package has bunch of functions to spin up new processes,\nconsume their outputs and errors. Also, spawned process can be stopped. Usually, we run external programs for a short period\nof time to make some side-effect. Then, we analyse its exit code to apply some error handling logic in our main Scala program.\nIt worth to say that process API is blocking execution thread, when we are waiting for its completion. To summarise, Scala\ndeveloper wants to do the following:\n\n\nStart external program as a process by giving a string containing command to be executed in underlying operating system.\nWait for completion and get the exit code.\nCancel spawned process, in case waiting time for its completion is greater than a certain threshold.\n\nGood news, we can do all of that in Cats-Effect leveraging IO monad to handle a side-effect and having timeout logic around.\nHandle blocking code\nBesides usual ContextShift, we will use separate thread pool to run blocking code of process API.\nCats-Effect provides Blocker class to evaluate specific IO on a given execution context. In case below, we are going\nto use CachedThreadPool, which can grow almost infinitely. Our main execution context will be still ExecutionContext.global\nand it will be used for non-blocking operations.\n\nBlocking Task\nBlocker has blockOn method, which takes an IO and returns an IO to be evaluated on the specified earlier thread pool.\n\nUsing Cats-Effect Bracket type class we can safely start our\nprocess and handle its IO cancelation. On task cancel event, we are going to call Process#destroy method to stop running in OS.\n\nAbove pattern matching case on Canceled, we stop process p using destroy().\nRun a task with timeout\nOne of the way to run Cats IO with timeout is to use its race method from Concurrent type class. Second\ntask in race is a call of Timer#sleep, which is semantically blocking an IO for a specified duration.\nLet's bring special function to start a race for two IOs and have third task as fallback IO, in case first IO\nwas not completed before timeout. Below function was reused from Cats-Effect documentation:\n\nNow we are ready to run our blocking task with timeout. For the sake of example, we set 1 second as timeout and failing returned IO,\nby giving fallback IO with exception. Let us run infinitely running command such tail -f on some file to simulate\nlong-running task, which we need to cancel in case of timeout.\n\nOutput\n\nHappy case:\n\nSummary\n\nUsing Bracket we can easily catch IO cancelation and release acquired resource.\nIn the example above, we destroy external process, so that OS resource is released.\nCats Blocker helps us to run blocking tasks safely with regards\nto other non-blocking tasks.\nAnd IO.race can be used to simulate timeout, since it cancels race looser.\n\nMisc\nPhoto by Maico Amorim on Unsplash","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-ce-timeout/","title":"Cats-Effect: Cancel Scala Process on Timeout"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-fs2/":{"body":"Recently, I ran into a familiar situation by doing data processing, where I needed to deal with a fragmented data stream. Having fragments, I had to detect manually where exactly new line/message starts and where current line/message ends in the stream. As turned out, one can aggregate intermediate state of the fragmented stream using scan function.\nLet us dig down into how scan function is working.\n\n\n\nScan function\nFS2 Stream Scan combinator works similar to scan function in Scala collection library. Official Scala doc for scan:\n\nsays:\n\n  Computes a prefix scan of the elements of the collection.\n  \n  -- Scala doc\n  \n\n\nHm, what this would mean? It is much easier to try it and see how it works.\nHere is visual diagram for scan:\n\nLet’s try with simple List using Scala REPL.\n\nIf we just aggregate and return acc every time in op function:\n\n\n\nIf we apply some if condition based on the element content, then we can control, which element is going to be added into output collection:\n\n\nAs we can see, once boolean condition in the if is true, we return only the current element e and start new accumulation, i.e. produce next element without all the stuff we accumulated before. Hopefully, these two examples help to grasp an idea of the scan function.\nCSV file processing using FS2\nLet’s first create a Scala IOApp using cats-effect library, which is coming as FS2 dependency, and define FS2 blocking execution context to work with files.\n\nAbove processFile function will be returning a stream taking a file path to be processed as CSV file.\nprocessFile implementation:\n\nThe main code of finding the complete CSV line (a line, which can have multiple parts of one logical CSV line separated by line brakes like \\n) starts at line:\n\nInside the scan function, we delegate ‘op’ part to concatBrokenLine function:\n\nusing regular expression isNextId we identify, whether new line marker is found. In the regular expression we want to find a number following by semicolon (according to current file business logic).\nRead the inline comments in the concatBrokenLines function on how using if/else logic, we control what needs to be put into next element of the downstream. As you can see, we use second half of the accumulator to push the complete line further (in the if branch).\nNow looking at scan and its concatBrokenLines function together, we can summarise:\nwe process CSV lines by folding them via scan function using empty element as a tuple of two empty strings (“”, “”). In the head of the scanning lambda we use only first part of the zero element, we call it acc, i.e. accumulator. We also have line variable, which is given by the Stream.scan function itself. Then, we delegate the decision on what needs to be returned to the downstream using filter function. Basically, we use filter as a guard to control what actually needs to be passed further for the main processing logic as CVS line.\nAlso, we append fake line to be able to process the very last line. This last line needs one more marker to be properly detected as complete line:\n\nTest of the FS2 code\nUsing file input.csv:\n\nwe print the resulted lines of the stream in the processRow function. In real life this function supposed to do something useful:\n\nOutput:\n\nSummary\nApplying knowledge of functional combinators, we have gotten concise and clean code, without using any global mutable state outside of the stream definition. We have also solved the problem within the single data stream using scan to aggregate intermediate state and filter function as a guard to discard incomplete CSV lines.\nFS2 library is very nice and especially having Cats and Cats-effect as direct dependency.\nSee more examples for functional streaming in FS2 guide\nSource code: https://github.com/novakov-alexey/fs2-csv-scan\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-fs2/","title":"Scala FS2 - handle broken CSV lines"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-monads/":{"body":"Once you start dig deeper into Scala and its suitability for functional programming, you meet Monads. In this blog post, we will explore Monads in Scala:\ntheir usage and usefulness.\n\n\n\nWhat is Monad?\nYou have probably already heard this quote:\n\n  A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors\n  \n  -- Saunders Mac Lane\n  \n\nMore details on StackOverflow answer\nWell, that does not bring much help. Obviously, Monad is not just Scala pattern, but it is something what is coming\nfrom Category Theory.\nHowever, we are not going to touch Category Theory in general, but let's say that Monad definition is coming from abstract theory of Mathematics.\nI like another definition of Monad, which is given in the  book \"Functional Programming in Scala\":\n\n  Monad is an abstract interface\n  \n  -- Chiusano, Bjarnason\n  \n\nIt is more clear for programmers. Before we clarify in details what Monad is, let us look at some examples of Mondas in Scala standard library.\nThis might already click for you that Monad is not something from aliens:\n\nOption\nEither\nList\nFuture\nMap\nSet\nStream\nVector\nTry\n\n... and others\nWhat makes thing a Monad?\nThere are several minimum combinations of functions which make some type a Monad. One of the popular minimum set is two functions:\n\nflatMap - also known as bind\nunit - also known as pure in Cats library or apply in pure Scala\n\nThese two functions implemented for some type bring powerful abstraction to write complex programs easy.\nMake your Monad\nMonad sometimes reminds a container to work with its values using special interface. If we model Monad ourselves, then it may look like a box with a thing\ninside, which we access using flatMap and one more useful function map:\n\nmap - is implemented in terms of flatMap + unit (i.e. Box class constructor).\nSo we can implement map for any kind of Monads, as we will see that later.\nNow let's use Box  Monad to show some usage example:\n\nBox contains single integer value and allows us to manipulate it without leaving Box context, i.e. our result is always a Box[T].\nWe can also make variable v as public and read it when needed. Box behaves similarly to non-empty single element list.\nIt is hard to say when this particular Box Monad will be useful looking at above example. However, it should give you an idea how Monad implementation may look like.\nScala Examples\nList\nList operates on collection of values.\n\nOption\nOption has two sub-types: Some and None.\nSome is like non-empty single element list, similar to Box Monad example above.\nNone ignores application of lambda function in flatMap or map.\n\nExample above won't return value of isOn variable because the first flatMap call returns None because of isBlack, so that second flatMap even won't be called.\nGeneric Monad\nWe have already seen example of at least 3 Monads above. In order to detach definition of Monad from its concrete implementation like\nList or Option, let us define abstract Monad interface using Scala high-order types feature:\n\nFunctor is one more abstraction which is more simpler than Monad. It requires only map implementation. We can say that every Monad also a Functor.\nFunctor is also coming from the Category Theory. I decided to mention it here, because you will frequently find it in the context of Monads,\nwhen learning functional programming in general. Abstract Monad interface can also implement map in terms of flatMap and unit functions,\nso that map is implemented automatically for any concrete implementation of some Monad.\nFunction application in flatMap\nAn application of f function in flatMap and map depends on the concrete Monad instance. In one case the lambda\nfunction we pass to the flatMap is always executed, in another cases not. Examples:\n\"f\" applied when:\n\nOption[A]: is Some(A)\nEither[A, B]: is Right(B)\nList[A]: is non-empty\nFuture[A]: is ready\n\nEven though flatMap behaves differently on concrete Monad instance, there is still great benefits to use them in any ordinary program.\nIn order to classify some type as a Monad, it needs to comply with Monad Laws and that is closing the definition of Monads. Let's look\nat Monad laws before we move further to practical examples.\nMonad Laws\n1. Identity\nResult of a function which creates Monad instance using unit is equal to application of this function over already created Monad instance.\nExample:\n\nAbstract definition of Identity Law:\n1.1 Left identity\n\n1.2 Right identity\n\n2. Associative\nApplication of f1 and f2 functions one after another yields the same result as applying them within the first flatMap.\nExample:\n\nAbstract definition:\n\nFunctor Laws\n1. Identity\nExample:\n\nAbstract definition:\n\n2. Associative\nExample:\n\nStandard Scala function compose return a function which applies f1 and then f2 taking the result of the first f1 function.\nAbstract definition:\n\nApplication of Monads\nUsing Monads we can do sequential composition. If we have several values in form of Option, we can sequence them into logic program,\nwhich evaluates next value based on the flatMap behaviour of the previous value.\nCompose Option\n\nFinal result of this program is Some(..) value. However, it could result into None, if one these three values is None.\nCompose Either\nThe following three functions return Either Monad, so that we can compose them into a sequence.\n\nWe can compose them in same manner as we have done with Option example above:\n\nFrom business logic perspective we want to create some hypothetical cluster if namespace is valid and cluster for the given namespace does not exist.\nWe implemented errors as Either.Left and normal result as Either.Right. Interface like Either is a popular approach not only in Scala to have some sort of result wrapper\nfor normal and error results.\nFinal result value is based on the return values we hardcoded in the given functions:\n\nBenefits of using Monads is that we do not need to use if/else control flow, since we have Monads Laws working when we compose Monad instances.\nIn case some of the given function returns Either.Left, for example:\n\nThen it turns the whole result of the composition into error state, i.e. into Either.Left:\n\nFor comprehension\nScala offers special syntax for the sequence of nested flatMap calls and one map at the end, which is called \"for-comprehension\".\nfor {…} yield is a syntactic sugar for a sequence of calls:\n\nDesugared version:\nBehind the scene, Scala compiler desugars the for-comprehension into the following code:\n\nSugared version of the same code snippet:\n\nFor-comprehension of this program is much more readable and thus recommended to be used when composing monadic values in particular programs.\nCaveat with Monads\n\n\n\n\nWe can easily compose Monads of the same types, like we have seen in examples, all values were options or eithers and so on.\nHowever, it is not straightforward to compose different Monad stacks, like Option and Either values in one sequence.\nLet's look at the example of such problem below.\nProblem\nLet's make one of the value in the for-comprehension to be different type, so that we will try to compose different Monads:\n\nIf we try to compile below code:\n\nThis is going to end up in compiler errors:\n\nFirst Monadic value rules them all.\nOnce we put first value such as validateNamespace, which returns Either[_, _], it starts\nto drive the return type of the flatMap function. Second nested value is not Either type, but Option[_]. Here it starts to brake\nthe Monad interface and eventually won't let it compile the code. What we need is to align monadic values to common ground.\nMonad Transformer\nIn order to compose different Monad types, we can use one more pattern called Monad Transformer.\nMonad Transformer is a custom-written Monad designed specifically for composition. Of course we could tackle above problem\nby unboxing Option, then checking what is in the Either, return Either again to make for-comprehension to be compiled. However,\nthis would be clumsy and not scalable solution in terms of code maintenance. Monad Transformers example:\n\nOptionT to compose Option + Any other Monad\nEitherT to compose Either + Any other Monad\nReaderT to compose Reader + Any other Monad\nWriterT to compose Writer + Any other Monad\n... others\n\nIf we want to compose Option Monad with other monadic values of type Either, then we need to use EitherT monad for Option.\nEitherT instance knows how to unbox and box Option to operate on nested Either and thus guide the flatMap function.\nLet us look at EitherT example implementation taken from Cats library:\n\nSee inline comments above. One more important point is that we expect an implicit Monad instance for that outer Monad\nF[_]. We use it to unwrap first Monad, by convention this variable is also named F.\nSo Monad Transformer does not do any magic, but it is just a type constructor, which returns a Monad as result.\nApply Monad Transformer\nNow let us use the same example and define return values:\n\nWe are going to use EitherT instance from Cats library.\n\nSince we introduced Monad transformer into composition, we have to use it for all the monadic values in the same sequence of flatMaps.\nSo, we have to wrap first value and third value into EitherT as well using extension method to EitherT.\nIn the result we have two layers of Monads too. First Option, then Either:\n\nAlternative case, when some of the statement in composition yields an error value:\n\nIn the result, our composition stopped on the second statement. clusterExists returns Some(Left(...)), so that\nEitherT could detect that Either.Left is end of the journey and entire composition ended on Left even it is wrapped into Some.\nBasically, Monad transformer looks into two layers one by one, when chaining monadic values. This was our goal\nto get a concise program and handle nested monadic value on composition in the same time.\nSummary\nMonad and Monad transformers are useful abstractions in every day life of functional programmer.\nAlthough it may seems like Monad is programming language on its own, it allows us to write programs based on the Laws!!!\nWe can compose different monadic values without using much a control flow.\nIn the result, we get fewer logical errors in the code, better structured programs and\nwhat is more important we get possibility to change programs in future much easier without breaking the entire world.\nNow go and flatMap all the things :-)\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-monads/","title":"Monads in Scala"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/spark-api/":{"body":"\n\n\nContext\nAs part of my role of Data Architect at work, I often deal with AWS data services to run Apache Spark jobs such as EMR and Glue ETL. At the very beginning team needed to choose Spark supported programming language and start writing our main jobs for data processing.\nBefore we further dive into the languages choice, let's quickly remind what is Spark for EMR. Glue ETL is going to be skipped from the blog-post.\nApache Spark is one of the main component of AWS EMR, which makes EMR still meaningful service to be used by Big Data teams. AWS EMR team is building its own Spark distribution to integrate it with other EMR applications seamlessly. Even though Amazon builds own Spark, they keep the same Spark version, which is equal to open source version of Spark. All features of Apache Spark are available in EMR Spark. EMR allows to run a Spark application in EMR cluster via step type called “Spark Application”.\nSpark APIs\nApache Spark is mainly written in Scala programming language, which is running on top of JVM. Scala is more than the 15 years old programming language with state of the art eco-system of development tools like SBT, its plugin eco-system and many others. Scala was developed to enable programmers to write scale-able code in terms of code base size. That means one can tackle very large problem with small amount of Scala code.\nSpark has also Java code in its main code base. Both languages are working in the same application without any problems. With rise of Data Science domain, Spark community brought R and Python languages support and started to support their SDKs officially as part of the Apache Spark repository. One of the main reason of adding Python and R was to enable Data Scientists to do data preparation for their further work using massive parallel execution engine which Spark is. In summary, there are 5 APIs that Spark supports today:\n\nScala\nJava\nSQL\nPython a.k.a PySpark\nR\n\nSQL is available from all supported above languages using string expressions.\nFirst 3 APIs are native, so entire application execution is controlled only by JVM instances running on driver and executor side. In case of PySpark, there are Python interpreters on driver and executor sides, which require additional resources on cluster and client side. However, most of the execution is still happening inside the JVMs even the PySpark SDK is submitting the code. Spark DataFrame API was introduced in Spark some time ago to align performance of all supported languages. There is one major downside still exists when using Python. This issue arises when Spark JVM code needs to communicate with Spark-Python user code back and forth. Communication between Python and JVM processes is done via TCP Sockets, so the overhead of data serialization/de-serialization takes place. Such communication is not so intensive to produce performance penalties, unless user is using User-defined-Function (UDFs) in Python code.\nOther Python limitations are coming from the language ergonomics itself. These limitations hurt productivity of data engineers especially when it comes to write internal/corporate library with typical data processing jobs. Still, Python can be easily used for data exploration in EMR Notebooks and/or PySpark shell.\nScala Benefits\n\nStatically typed code is verified by Scala compiler. Enables ease of program code refactoring. This is the main feature of language like Scala that eliminates issues in runtime, which may cause a lot of harm if data processing job fails on some program statement after running for 4 hours already.\nIDE support: code error syntax highlighting, autocomplete, go-to definition to Spark Scala/Java API or own application code. PyCharm or similar Python IDE do not easily work with Spark type-stubs. Out of the Spark, IDE features are by an order of magnitude better for statically typed languages than for dynamically typed languages.\nSBT (scala build tool similar to Maven in Java) allows to version and package Spark program code as a JAR file using sbt-assembly plugin and upload it to S3 bucket using few build commands.\nHuge eco-system of Java and Scala libraries. Any library from Maven/Ivy repository can be called directly from Spark driver or executor side.\nScala benefits over Java language as well, because Java has quite verbose language syntax.\n\nPython Challenges\n\nSyntax validation. Mypy or similar Python type-checker can be used to validate optional type annotations. However, that does not prevent a programmer to ship syntactically incorrect code to EMR Step execution, unless it is deployed by CI/CD job. Using Scala, one can't ship incorrect code to Spark without going through the compilation phase.\nRefactoring is labor-intensive. Usually, Spark programs evolve to a home-grown library of data-processing jobs that requires code sharing to get manageable and scaleable codebase. Often times it is hard to refactor Python code automatically or semi-automatically even with IDE. Editors and IDEs work better for statically typed languages, since they introspect type annotations and make decision on wrong/correct syntax highlighting, automatic renaming and other refactoring tasks. Refactored Python program requires severe testing than it would be needed for a Scala program. Code refactoring here is not necessarily related to Spark API, but to that parts which combine user's and Spark's code all together.\nWhite-space sensitivity and back-slash continuation syntax. Due to the fact that Spark API is extensively using “builder” pattern. Such as when program statements are split by dot and line break characters in the same time. This can also be done in Python with back-slash syntax or wrapping the entire statement in parentheses, which clutters the code.\n\nScala Learning Curve\n\nIn order to write Spark code in Scala, one can learn that in one day. Spark DataFrame API is almost identical across all Spark languages. Programmers do not require to know all Scala language aspects, but they can discover them over time.\nScala function definition syntactically looks very like Python function definition. Difference becomes even smaller, when using optional type annotation in Python. Python developers usually find Scala's syntax quite familiar.\nThere are many resources and free courses on Scala fundamentals, which were produced over the last 10 years in Scala eco-system.\nIntelliJ IDEA provides well-supported JetBrains Scala Plugin for a long time. There is also light alternative to IntelliJ like VSCode + Metals LSP (Metals),\nThe last one is an implementation of Language Server Protocol for Scala.\nKnowledge of Java helps to learn Scala, but they are not mandatory.\n\nSummary\nNo matter whether you are going to use data science libraries in Python further down the line of data pipelines, it worth to consider Scala as the main data processing language.\nHaving Scala as main language for your data platform APIs, data processing pipelines and DevOps makes the work of software engineers as a joy. Python may seems easy language to use and pick up, but its dynamic types and cumbersome syntax leads to a refactoring nightmare and makes the entire code base as one giant technical debt, which can't be easily eliminated.\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/spark-api/","title":"Spark API Languages"},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/tensorflow-scala/":{"body":"\nTensorFlow Scala is a strongly-typed Scala API for TensorFlow core C++ library developed by Anthony Platanios. This library\nintegrates with native TensorFlow library via JNI, so no intermediate official/non-official Java libraries are used.\n\nIn this article we will implement \"multiple linear\nregression\" from the previous article about Customer Churn using TensorFlow.\nSetup Project\nI am going to use SBT, but you can also use any other Scala-aware build tool.\nNew SBT project configuration:\n\nIn order to add TensorFlow Scala to existing project, just add two library dependencies from above configuration. tensorflow-data module is optional, but we are going to use it\nin this article as well.\nImportant: I am using OSX, so my classifier is darwin. In case you use Linux or Windows, please change classifier value to currently available classifiers for those platforms, check it here to be sure: https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/platanios/tensorflow_2.13/0.5.10/.\nTensor API\nBefore start implementing an Artificial Neural Network with TensorFlow, let's\nbriefly look at how we can load data into a tensor.\nWe would need to create matrices, so we can use Scala collections and map\nArrays to Tensors and put them as rows into another Tensor. For example:\n\nwill print:\n\nData Preparation\nTensorFlow Scala also has data API to load datasets. We will use that API\npartly. Unfortunately, current documentation does not give an idea how to use Data API, so that we will use partly. Most of data preparation code I took from previous article.\nCustom Code\n\nTensor API\nContinuation of loadData:\n\nAs per comments above, we prepare training and test data and return it as 4\ndifferent Tensor objects. Also, we return a function as fifth element of the tuple\nfor one more application (read further).\nFull code of data preparation that includes:\n\nselecting specific CSV file columns\nnormalising numeric columns\nencoding categorical columns as one-hot\nencoding label-like columns\n\nsee here:\n\nencoders\nTextLoader\n\nModel Assembly\nWe are going to learn on 12 features to predict one target.\n\nbatchSize will be used in a couple of places of TensorFlow API.\nIn order to construct all 12 x 6 x 6 x 1 network below:\n\n\n\n\nwe use the following API:\n\nlayer state is a composition of fully-connected layers with its own activation function. We specify String name for each layer that will be eventually used in TensorFlow graph.\n\nWe are going to use L2, which is a half least square error as a loss function.\nAnd Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) as weights optimization algorithm.\nFinally, we pass above values to construct simple supervised model.\n\nYou can also create unsupervised model with .unsupervised method, if needed.\nAs we can see, model construction is highly declarative as the entire TensorFlow Scala library API.\nEstimator\nAnother abstraction in TensorFlow we are going to use is Estimator. It is used to train, predict, evaluate and export for serving the TensorFlow models. In some other libraries, an estimator is usually a model abstraction itself. Estimator provides nice separation from the input data and actual model to train.\nDataset\nBefore we construct an estimator we need to wrap the input data into a Dataset. As I mentioned before, the TensorFlow Scala provides a data package to\nload some data formats in streaming way / lazily. This is recommended way to use this library that allows us to iterate over the data in streaming fashion, so the full dataset does not need to fit into memory. However, our current example dataset is quite small. so that we used custom code to load and transform the data before we start any learning. Now we have to wrap Tensors into Datasets:\n\nOutput\nAbove code creates training dataset as combination of features and labels outputs.\nCore TensorFlow library has an idea of Output abstraction. The Output is a symbolic handle that represents a tensor value produced by an Operation. In other words, it is future state of a Tensor once particular operand is applied to that tensor. It does not hold the values of that operation\noutput, but instead provides a means of computing those values in a TensorFlow Session, which is another TensorFlow abstraction. The session is created automatically by the Estimator. One can also construct TensorFlow session manually, we are not going to do this in this article.\nTraining Metrics\nOne of the place where we work with Outputs directly in this example, is\ntraining metric configuration. For binary classification we need to transform predicted\nvalues by the model to 0 and 1.\n\nI think to transform predicted values to binary values, i.e. 1 and 0 can be done more efficient than filling true boolean values with 1 and false values with 0 using tf.select function, but I could not find another way.\nWe will use above accuracy metric in estimator construction.\nConstruct Estimator\n\nAbove code configures:\n\nLogging in training loop:\n\nlog to summary directory \"temp/ann\"\nstore checkpoint at every 1000 step to summary directory\nlog at every 100 steps\nlog loss value at every 100 steps\n\n\nEvaluate metrics:\n\ncalculate accuracy metric (and any other specified metrics in Seq) at every 1000 step\nuse data specified in Evaluator datasets\n\n\nTake data for Tensorboard from summary directory\nStop after 100 000 step unless overridden by .train method\n\nNote: estimator works with step notion rather than with epoch. In order to calculate number of desired training steps, you can divide a number training records on batch size. In our case we have 8000 training records / 100 batch size = 80 steps. This is one epoch, i.e. one full training cycle on available dataset. In order to repeat training on the same model parameters 100 times, i.e. 100 epochs instead of 1 epoch we need 80 * 100 = 8000 steps. So if we set 10 000 steps we ask for 125 epochs since 2000 steps is 25 epochs.\nTraining\n\nFinally we are starting the training loop. We pass the same trainData as we used\nfor metric evaluation. However, we could use different datasets for training and metric evaluations. We override maxSteps with 10 000. As we have only 10k rows in CSV file, we do not need initial 100 000 steps for training. TensorFlow\nOnce we run train method, we can see the following output in console:\n\nthere will be 11 logging statements for intermediate accuracy value, so I copied only the last summary.\ntrain method returns Unit, so it mutates state of the estimator, so that you can use\nit further for model inference.\nSingle test\n\nWe use dataTransformer function one more time for converting raw single data record into\nnumeric format that our model can understand and return a target value for it:\n\nfalse is expected value for that simple example.\nBatch test\nWe can also submit data batch to infer a target value for each record.\n\nWe are going to calculate the accuracy metric manually based on known labels for train and test datasets:\n\n\nAlthough we used again the same data for checking accuracy, however one can take new / unseen\ndata to check the accuracy on just trained or loaded from checkpoint estimator.\nTensorboard\nTensorboard is an additional tool from TensorFlow main framework. It can be installed via pip tool:\n\nWe enable Tensorboard as part of Estimator configuration. Every time we run training cycle for an estimator with Tensorboard configured, we get the following console message:\n\nTensorFlow starts a web-app at localhost on port 6006 and using data from the the log directory that we configured at estimator level.\nLog directory accumulates TensorFlow logs between training cycles, so that if we run training\ncycle again and again we can see that estimator variables (graph state) is restored from that\nlogging folder. Eventually, our model loss and accuracy metric values are going to be stable, i.e. not improving anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nTensorFlow Scala is a fantastic library that mimics most of TensorFlow core library and Python API.\nAlthough current library is missing some documentations, one can always use official TensorFlow documentation web-site to get an idea of the Scala API.\nImplemented ANN in TensorFlow Scala shows that one can use Scala to train Deep Learning models easily. Training program in Scala are going to be quite declarative and statically type-checked which eliminates lots of mistakes. Library API also allows to extend most of the abstractions, which is very important for real life use cases.\nSource Code\nFull source code as SBT project can be found here:\n\nhttps://github.com/novakov-alexey/tensorflow-scala-example\n\n","id":"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/tensorflow-scala/","title":"TensorFlow Scala - Linear Regression via ANN"}},"docInfo":{"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/adam-optimizer/":{"body":540,"title":4},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/algorithms-max-sum-in-array/":{"body":164,"title":5},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ammonite-kafka/":{"body":353,"title":3},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-in-scala-1/":{"body":1416,"title":6},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-in-scala-2/":{"body":1132,"title":6},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/ann-mnist/":{"body":869,"title":8},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/aws-saa-exam/":{"body":1242,"title":5},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/cnn-in-scala/":{"body":736,"title":4},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/cv/":{"body":1076,"title":1},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/decision-tree/":{"body":462,"title":3},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/delta-lake/":{"body":563,"title":4},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/face-identification/":{"body":565,"title":4},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/flink-ml/":{"body":1631,"title":3},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/flink-model-formats/":{"body":740,"title":4},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/flink-scala3/":{"body":327,"title":5},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/k8s-operator/":{"body":824,"title":6},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/linear-regression/":{"body":474,"title":4},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/presentations/":{"body":256,"title":1},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/sbt-plugins/":{"body":893,"title":2},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-ce-timeout/":{"body":316,"title":6},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-fs2/":{"body":393,"title":6},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/scala-monads/":{"body":997,"title":2},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/spark-api/":{"body":787,"title":3},"https://novakov-alexey.github.io/tensorflow-scala/":{"body":876,"title":6}},"length":25},"lang":"English"}
